#This is a super, super basic schema that definitely can be added to and revised. It should work to start marking stuff up for now, though. 

#Root element
start = ulysses 

#Accounting for the fact that dialogue may exist outside of the paragraph. 
ulysses = element ulysses{(section | chapter | paragraph | said)+}
section = element section{sectionName, empty}
sectionName = attribute sectionName{"The Telemachiad" | "The Wanderings of Ulysses" | "The Homecoming"}

#The paragraph contains information about various references, including literary allusions and locations.
#There are probably other types of references that we could include, and so this is an element that could be revised.
#Also looking at the people operating in a paragraph, who is saying things, and what they have said. 
paragraph = element paragraph{n, mixed{location | allusion | person | event | speaker | said | reference | vocab}+}

#We want to link each reference (allusion, person, event, etc.) to the paragraph in which it occurs. 
#We do that with n. Really, I'm questioning whether this is necessary at all but it's here for now. 
n = attribute n{xsd:integer}
#This is an attribute to encapsulate information about location. I think that this element is currently not finished, because I would like to include information 
#about lat and long somewhere in this location hierarchy. I'm waiting to include that until we get more information on how best to convert partial street addresses 
#to geodata. I'm also hoping to number each location with locRef so that we can then tie other references to specific locations. 
#I'm also wondering about how best to use this element to tag locations that aren't specifically referenced in the text but are alluded to nonetheless. Perhaps an empty 
#element tag would serve this purpose. 
location = element location{n, locRef, mixed{address}}
locRef = attribute locRef{xsd:integer}
address = element address{mixed{street}}
street = element street{text}

#This is an element to encapsulate an allusion, in particularly a literary allusion. We list attributes to connect it to the paragraph it is contained in, the location it
#is connected to (most likely the location mentioned previously), and a "to" attribute to list the literary author to whom the allusion is referencing. 
allusion = element allusion{n, locRef, to, text}
#I'm including this as text right now, rather than persName, because I'm not sure that every literary work referenced in this piece will be tied to a specific author. 
#However, this could easily be edited to reference a persName. 
to = attribute to {text}
#References to people, probably historical or political figures mentioned explicitly in the text. Tie these in with the paragraph in which they are contained and 
#the location they are connected to (again, probably the location listed tagged previous to the person reference). 
person = element person{n, locRef, mixed{persName}}
persName = attribute persName{text}
#References to events, probably historical or political, that are alluded to in the text. 
event = element event{n, locRef, mixed{date | location}}
#I'm trying to encapsulate most of the dates that will be referenced with this attribute. Perhaps there are other datatypes which will better reference the dates referenced in 
#the text, but I'm using these three for now. 
date = attribute date{xsd:date | xsd:gYear | xsd:gYearMonth}
#The following two elements are keeping track of who says what in the text. I'm linking the two with persName, at least for now. 
speaker = element speaker{mixed{persName, (location | allusion | person | event | said | reference | vocab)+}}
said = element said{mixed{persName}}
#This is an element to encapsulate other, miscellaneous references that probably exist but that I just haven't thought of. Of course, we're linking these 
#to their parent paragraph and to their relative location. I'm also including a "meaning" attribute as somewhat of a catch-all term for describing what the reference
#is referring to. 
reference = element reference{n, locRef, mixed{meaning}}
meaning = attribute meaning{text}
#The vocab element will be used to encapsulate unfamiliar vocabulary terms, whether those are British idioms or Joyce-isms that appear in the text. They are to be 
#described with a meaning attribute to provide something of a definition for the unfamiliar term or phrase. 
vocab = element vocab{mixed{meaning}}
