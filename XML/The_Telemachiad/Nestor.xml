<said persName = "Stephen"><said>—You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?</said></said>

<said persName = "class"><said>—Tarentum, sir.</said></said>

<said persName = "Stephen"><said>—Very good. Well?</said></said>

<said persName = "class"><said>—There was a battle, sir.</said></said>

<said persName = "Stephen"><said>—Very good. Where?</said></said>

<paragraph ><speaker persName = "Stephen">The boy’s blank face asked the blank window.
<location  locRef = "1"><address><street>Dalkey, Dublin Bay</street></address></location>
<allusion  locRef = "1" to = "William Blake">Fabled by the daughters of memory</allusion>. And yet it was in some way if not as
memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of <allusion  locRef="1" to = "William Blake">Blake’s wings
of excess.</allusion> <allusion  locRef="1" to = "William Blake">I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling
masonry, and time one livid final flame.</allusion> What’s left us then?</speaker></paragraph>

<said persName = "class">—I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the
gorescarred book.</said>

<said persName = "class">—Yes, sir. And he said: <allusion  locRef = "1" to = "Pyrrhus">_Another victory like that and we are done
for.</allusion>_</said>

<paragraph ><speaker persName = "Stephen">That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a
hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.</speaker></paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?</said>

<said persName = "Armstrong"><allusion  locRef = "1" to = "Pyrrhus">—End of Pyrrhus, sir?</allusion></said>

<said persName = "Comyn">—I know, sir. Ask me, sir, <reference  locRef="1" meaning = "ScottishFamily">Comyn</reference> said.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?</said>

<paragraph>A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel. He curled them
between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered
to the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy’s breath. Welloff people,
proud that their eldest son was in the navy. <reference  locRef="1" meaning = "ItalianPhilosopher">Vico Road, Dalkey.</reference></paragraph>

<said persName = "Armstrong">—Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.</said>

<paragraph>All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round
at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh
more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book,hat is a pier.</said>

<said persName = "Armstrong">—A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of aridge. <location locRef = "2"><address><street>Kingstown pier</street></address></location>, sir.</said>

<paragraph>Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench
whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.
All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their
likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets
tittering in the struggle.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—<location locRef = "2"><address><street>Kingstown pier</street></address></location>, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.</said>

<paragraph>The words troubled their gaze.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Comyn">—How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.</said>

<paragraph>For Haines’s chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild
drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A
jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a
clement master’s praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly
for the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other
too often heard, their land a pawnshop.</paragraph>

<paragraph>Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or <reference locRef = "2" meaning = "RomanHistory">Julius Caesar</reference> not
been knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has branded
them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the <allusion locRef = "2" to = "Aristotle">infinite
possibilities they have ousted</allusion>. But can those have been possible seeing
that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass?
Weave, weaver of the wind.</paragraph>

<said persName = "class">—Tell us a story, sir.</said>

<said persName = "class">—O, do, sir. A ghoststory.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.</said>

<said persName = "Comyn">—_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Go on then, Talbot.</said>

<said persName = "class">—And the story, sir?</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.</said>

<paragraph>A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork
of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:</paragraph>

<said persName = "Talbot">—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more
For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._</said>

<paragraph>It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.
Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated
out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where
he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his
elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding
brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating
feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld,
reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought
is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner
all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast,
candescent: form of forms.</paragraph>

<paragraph>Talbot repeated:</paragraph>

<said persName = "Talbot">—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,

Through the dear might..._</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don’t see anything.</said>

<said persName = "Talbot">—What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.</said>

<paragraph>His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having
just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these
craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and
on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the
tribute. To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s. A long look
from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the
church’s looms. Ay.

     Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.
     My father gave me seeds to sow.</paragraph>

<paragraph>Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Have I heard all? Stephen asked.</said>

<said persName = "Talbot">—Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.</said>

<said persName = "class">—Half day, sir. Thursday.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.</said>

<paragraph>They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all
gabbling gaily:</paragraph>

<said persName = "class">—A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.</said>

<said persName = "class">—O, ask me, sir.</said>

<said persName = "class">—A hard one, sir.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—This is the riddle, Stephen said:

     The cock crew,
     The sky was blue:
     The bells in heaven
     Were striking eleven.
     ’Tis time for this poor soul
     To go to heaven.

What is that?</said>

<said persName = "class">—What, sir?</said>

<said persName = "class">—Again, sir. We didn’t hear.</said>

<paragraph>Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence
Cochrane said:</paragraph>

<said persName = "Cochrane">—What is it, sir? We give it up.</said>

<paragraph>Stephen, his throat itching, answered:</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.</said>

<paragraph>He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries
echoed dismay.</paragraph>

<paragraph>A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:</paragraph>

<said persName = "class">—Hockey!</said>

<paragraph>They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly
they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and
clamour of their boots and tongues.</paragraph>

<paragraph>Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
copybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his
cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
and damp as a snail’s bed.</paragraph>

<paragraph>He held out his copybook. The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Sargent">—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show themo you, sir.</said>

<paragraph>Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.</said>

<said persName = "Sargent">—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was toopy them off the board, sir.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.</said>

<said persName = "Sargent">—No, sir.</said>

<paragraph>Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a
snail’s bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in
her heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him
underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery
blood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in
life? His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal
bestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in
the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from
being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor
soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red
reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the
earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.</paragraph>

<paragraph>Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by
algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather. Sargent
peered askance through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the
lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.</paragraph>

<paragraph>Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of
their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,
traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from
the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and
movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the
world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not
comprehend.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?</said>

<said persName = "Sargent">—Yes, sir.</said>

<paragraph>In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a
word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint
hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin. _Amor matris:_ subjective
and objective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had
fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.</paragraph>

<paragraph>Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My
childhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or
lightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony
sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their
tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.</paragraph>

<paragraph>The sum was done.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.</said>

<said persName = "Sargent">—Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.</said>

<paragraph>He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen saids he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.</said>

<said persName = "Sargent">—Yes, sir.</said>

<paragraph>In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Sargent!</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.</said>

<paragraph>He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and
Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to
him. He turned his angry white moustache.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—What is it now? he cried continually without listening.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.</said>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restorerder here.</said>

<paragraph>And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice
cried sternly:</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—What is the matter? What is it now?</said>

<paragraph>Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms
closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his
illdyed head.</paragraph>

<paragraph>Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded
leather of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here.
As it was in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart
coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their
spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached
to all the gentiles: world without end.</paragraph>

<paragraph>A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his
rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—First, our little financial settlement, he said.</said>

<paragraph>He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It
slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and
laid them carefully on the table.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.</said>

<paragraph>And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved
over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money
cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and
this, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead
treasure, hollow shells.</paragraph>

<paragraph>A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.hese are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is
for shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.</said>

<paragraph>He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Three twelve, he said. I think you’ll find that’s right.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shyaste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.</said>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.</said>

<paragraph>Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too
of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed
and misery.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You’ll pull it out somewherend lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You’ll find them very
handy.</said>

<paragraph>Answer something.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.</said>

<paragraph>The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times
now. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant
if I will.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don’tnow yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as
I have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare
say? _Put but money in thy purse._</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Iago, Stephen murmured.</said>

<paragraph>He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, butn Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you
know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s
mouth?</said>

<paragraph>The seas’ ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems
history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.</said>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That’s not English. A French Celt said that. Heapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. _I paidy way._</said>

<paragraph>Good man, good man.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel
that? _I owe nothing._ Can you?</said>

<paragraph>Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.
Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.
Temple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob
Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five
weeks’ board. The lump I have is useless.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—For the moment, no, Stephen answered.</said>

<paragraph>Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it.e are a generous people but we must also be just.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.</said>

<paragraph>Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the
shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of
Wales.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said. saw three generations since O’Connell’s time. I remember the famine
in ’46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the
union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your
communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.</said>

<paragraph>Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the
splendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the
planters’ covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie
down.</paragraph>

<paragraph>Stephen sketched a brief gesture.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But
I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are
all Irish, all kings’ sons.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Alas, Stephen said.</said>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for
it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to
do so.

     Lal the ral the ra
     The rocky road to Dublin.</said>

<paragraph>A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!
Soft day, your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling on
to Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,
with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.
Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.</said>

<paragraph>He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read
off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates ofommon sense._ Just a moment.</said>

<paragraph>He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow
and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,
sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.</paragraph>

<paragraph>Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed
around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek
heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ _Repulse_, the duke of
Westminster’s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort’s _Ceylon_, _prix de
Paris_, 1866. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their
speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished
crowds.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. _But prompt ventilation of thisllimportant question..._</said>

<paragraph>Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the
mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek
of the canteen, over the motley slush. Even money _Fair Rebel._ Ten to
one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs,
the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s
dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.</paragraph>

<paragraph>Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.</paragraph>

<paragraph>Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a
medley, the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling
who seems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock
by shock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of
the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.</said>

<paragraph>He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It’s about theoot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two
opinions on the matter.</said>

<paragraph>May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of _laissez faire_
which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old
industries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.
European conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the
channel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of
agriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who
was no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—I don’t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.</said>

<paragraph>Foot and mouth disease. Known as Koch’s preparation. Serum and virus.
Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor’s horses at Mürzsteg,
lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous
offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In
every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for
the hospitality of your columns.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the
next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be
cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is
regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They
offer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the
department. Now I’m going to try publicity. I am surrounded by
difficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...</said>

<paragraph>He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of theews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are
the signs of a nation’s decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the
nation’s vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as
we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of
destruction. Old England is dying.</said>

<paragraph>He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.

     The harlot’s cry from street to street
     Shall weave old England’s windingsheet.</said>

<paragraph>His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which
he halted.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew orentile, is he not?</said>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can seehe darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the
earth to this day.</said>

<paragraph>On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,
uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit
silk hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and
unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their
zeal was vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would
scatter all. A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the
dishonours of their flesh.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Who has not? Stephen said.</said>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.</said>

<paragraph>He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell
sideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from
me.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.</said>

<paragraph>From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human
history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.</said>

<paragraph>Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—That is God.</said>

<paragraph>Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—What? Mr Deasy asked.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.</said>

<paragraph>Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and
many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no
better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten
years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the
strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman,
O’Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many
errors, many failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the
end of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end.

     For Ulster will fight
     And Ulster will be right.</said>

<paragraph>Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Well, sir, he began.</said>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long athis work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am
wrong.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—A learner rather, Stephen said.</said>

<paragraph>And here what will you learn more?</paragraph>

<paragraph>Mr Deasy shook his head.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the greateacher.</said>

<paragraph>Stephen rustled the sheets again.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—As regards these, he began.</said>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have themublished at once.</said>

<paragraph>_ Telegraph. Irish Homestead._</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know twoditors slightly.</said>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,
M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the
City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You
see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—The Evening Telegraph..._</said>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have tonswer that letter from my cousin.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.hank you.</said>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. Iike to break a lance with you, old as I am.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.</said>

<paragraph>He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,
hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. The
lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:
toothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will
dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Mr Dedalus!</said>

<paragraph>Running after me. No more letters, I hope.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Just one moment.</said>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.</said>

<paragraph>Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour ofeing the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know
that? No. And do you know why?</said>

<paragraph>He frowned sternly on the bright air.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Stephen">—Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.</said>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.</said>

<paragraph>A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
rattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,
his lifted arms waving to the air.</paragraph>

<said persName = "Mr. Deasy">—She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That’s why.</said>

<paragraph>On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
     spangles, dancing coins.</paragraph>
