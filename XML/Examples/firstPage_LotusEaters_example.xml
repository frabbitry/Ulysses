<!--frc: For XML exercise 3, I chose to mark up page 71 (the first page of the Lotus-Eaters section)
of Ulysses by James Joyce. I wanted to tag a lot of references, and I know from reading it that no
page of this book disappoints in that regard. 

In particular, I wanted to look at how Joyce references Dublin locations. 
The city of Dublin is almost like a character itself in this book (and other works by Joyce),
especially if you read it from a postcolonial (or semi-postcolonial, I suppose, since it's 
Ireland) perspective. Therefore, I looked up all of the locations either explicitly referenced by 
Bloom on his walk around the quay or implicitly referenced through other people. Each paragraph 
is split into emotions, tones or moods that I interpreted Bloom as having either about his locations or
just in general as he walks, and then within each emotion I tag words or phrases that might be unfamiliar, 
locations, and references. That way, the locations can be looked at in some sort of context. 

While working on this project, I used Google Maps and Gifford and Seidman's "Notes for Joyce" (1974).-->
