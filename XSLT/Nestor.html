         <span class="Stephen">—You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?</span>
         
         <span class="class">—Tarentum, sir.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Very good. Well?</span>
         
         <span class="class">—There was a battle, sir.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Very good. Where?</span>
         
         
         <p> boy’s blank face asked the blank window. <span allusion="">Fabled by
               the daughters of memory</span>. And yet it was in some way if not as memory
            fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of <span allusion="William Blake">Blake’s wings of excess.</span>
            <span allusion="">I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and
               toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.</span> What’s left us
            then?
         </p>
         
         <span class="class">—I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the
            gorescarred book.</span>
         
         <span class="class">—Yes, sir. And he said: <span allusion="Pyrrhus">_Another victory
               like that and we are done for.</span>_</span>
         
         
         <p>That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a hill above a
            corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear. Any
            general to any officers. They lend ear.
         </p>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of
            Pyrrhus?</span>
         
         <span class="Armstrong"><span allusion="Pyrrhus">—End of Pyrrhus, sir?</span></span>
         
         <span class="Comyn">—I know, sir. Ask me, sir, <span ref="ScottishFamily">Comyn</span> said.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?</span>
         
         
         <p>A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel. He curled them between his palms
            at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips. A
            sweetened boy’s breath. Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.
            <span ref="ItalianPhilosopher">Vico Road, Dalkey.</span></p>
         
         <span class="Armstrong">—Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.</span>
         
         
         <p>All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round at his
            classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware
            of
            my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.
         </p>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the
            book,hat is a pier.</span>
         
         <span class="Armstrong">—A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind
            of aridge. Kingstown pier, sir.</span>
         
         
         <p>Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench whispered. Yes.
            They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. All. With envy he watched their
            faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with
            tea
            and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.
         </p>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.</span>
         
         
         <p>The words troubled their gaze.</p>
         
         <span class="Comyn">—How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.</span>
         
         
         <p>For Haines’s chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk,
            to
            pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A jester at the court of his master,
            indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master’s praise. Why had they chosen all
            that part? Not wholly for the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like
            any
            other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or <span ref="RomanHistory">Julius Caesar</span> not been knifed to death. They are not to be thought
            away. Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the <span allusion="">infinite possibilities they have ousted</span>. But can
            those have been possible seeing that they never were? <span allusion="">Or was that only possible which came to pass?</span>
            <span allusion="Bible">Weave, weaver of the wind.</span></p>
         
         <span class="class">—Tell us a story, sir.</span>
         
         <span class="class">—O, do, sir. A ghoststory.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another
            book.</span>
         
         <span class="Comyn">—_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Go on then, Talbot.</span>
         
         <span class="class">—And the story, sir?</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.</span>
         
         
         <p>A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.
            He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:
         </p>
         
         <span class="Talbot"><span allusion="">—Weep no more, woful shepherds,
               weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath
               the watery floor..._</span></span>
         
         
         <p>It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. <span allusion="">Aristotle’s phrase</span> formed itself within the
            gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of <span allusion="">Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the
               sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook
               of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with
               faintly beating feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld,
               reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.</span>
            <span allusion="">Thought is the thought of thought.</span> Tranquil
            brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms.
            Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Talbot repeated:</p>
         
         <span class="Talbot"><span allusion="">—Through the dear might of Him
               that walked the waves, Through the dear might..._</span></span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don’t see anything.</span>
         
         <span class="Talbot">—What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.</span>
         
         
         <p>His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having just
            remembered. <span allusion="Bible">Of him that walked the waves.</span> Here also
            over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on
            mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute. <span allusion="Bible">To <span ref="RomanHistory">Caesar</span> what is Caesar’s,
               to God what is God’s.</span> A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence
            to be woven and woven on the church’s looms. Ay. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro. My
            father gave me seeds to sow.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.</p>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Have I heard all? Stephen asked.</span>
         
         <span class="Talbot">—Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.</span>
         
         <span class="class">—Half day, sir. Thursday.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.</span>
         
         
         <p>They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling. Crowding together
            they
            strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily:
         </p>
         
         <span class="class">—A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.</span>
         
         <span class="class">—O, ask me, sir.</span>
         
         <span class="class">—A hard one, sir.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—This is the riddle, Stephen said: The cock crew, The sky was
            blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. ’Tis time for this poor soul To go
            to
            heaven. What is that?</span>
         
         <span class="class">—What, sir?</span>
         
         <span class="class">—Again, sir. We didn’t hear.</span>
         
         
         <p>Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence Cochrane said:</p>
         
         <span class="Cochrane">—What is it, sir? We give it up.</span>
         
         
         <p>Stephen, his throat itching, answered:</p>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.</span>
         
         
         <p>He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed
            dismay.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:</p>
         
         <span class="class">—Hockey!</span>
         
         
         <p>They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly they were
            gone
            and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and
            tongues.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook. His
            tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty
            glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain
            of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail’s bed.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>He held out his copybook. The word _Sums_ was written on the headline. Beneath were
            sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.
            Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.
         </p>
         
         <span class="Sargent">—<span ref="DeasyLandAct1860">Mr Deasy</span> told me to
            write them out all again, he said, and show themo you, sir.</span>
         
         
         <p>Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.</p>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.</span>
         
         <span class="Sargent">—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was
            toopy them off the board, sir.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.</span>
         
         <span class="Sargent">—No, sir.</span>
         
         
         <p>Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s bed. Yet
            someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart. But for her the race
            of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had
            loved his weak watery blood drained from her own. Was that then real? <span allusion="">The only true thing in life?</span> His mother’s
            prostrate body the fiery <span ref="IrishSaint">Columbanus</span> in holy
            zeal bestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire,
            an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampled
            underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a
            heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless
            bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped
            and scraped.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by algebra that
            Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather. Sargent peered askance through his
            slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball
            and calls from the field.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Across the page the symbols moved in grave <span ref="Moors">morrice</span>,
            in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give
            hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from the
            world, <span ref="ReligiousPhilosophers Aristotle">Averroes and Moses
               Maimonides</span>, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking
            mirrors the obscure soul of the world, <span allusion="Bible">a darkness shining in
               brightness which brightness could not comprehend.</span></p>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Do you understand now? Can you work the second for
            yourself?</span>
         
         <span class="Sargent">—Yes, sir.</span>
         
         
         <p>In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word of help his
            hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind
            his dull skin. _Amor matris:_ subjective and objective genitive. With her weak blood
            and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling
            bands.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My childhood bends beside
            me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly. Mine is far and his secret
            as
            our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets
            weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The sum was done.</p>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.</span>
         
         <span class="Sargent">—Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.</span>
         
         
         <p>He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back
            to
            his bench.
         </p>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen
            saids he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.</span>
         
         <span class="Sargent">—Yes, sir.</span>
         
         
         <p>In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.</p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—Sargent!</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.</span>
         
         
         <p>He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where
            sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away
            stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When he had reached the schoolhouse
            voices again contending called to him. He turned his angry white moustache.
         </p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—What is it now? he cried continually without listening.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen
            said.</span>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I
            restorerder here.</span>
         
         
         <p>And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly:</p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—What is the matter? What is it now?</span>
         
         
         <p>Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him,
            the
            garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.
            As on the first day he bargained with me here. <span allusion="Gloria Patri">As it was
               in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of <span ref="James II of England">Stuart coins</span>, base treasure of a bog:
               and ever shall be. And <span allusion="Bible">snug in their spooncase of purple
                  plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles:
                  world without end.</span></span></p>
         
         
         <p>A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his rare moustache
            Mr Deasy halted at the table.
         </p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—First, our little financial settlement, he said.</span>
         
         
         <p>He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It slapped open
            and
            he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the
            table.
         </p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook
            away.</span>
         
         
         <p>And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells
            heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and
            this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and this, the <span ref="pilgrimage">scallop
               of saint James</span>. An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead treasure, hollow
            shells.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.</p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in
            his hand.hese are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is for

         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—Three twelve, he said. I think you’ll find that’s
            right.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with
            shyaste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.</span>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.</span>
         
         
         <p>Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too of beauty
            and
            of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.
         </p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You’ll pull it out

         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.

         <p>He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.</p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet,
            yes, butn Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you know

         <span class="Stephen">—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.</span>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That’s not English. A French Celt said
            that. Heapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.

         <span class="Stephen">—For the moment, no, Stephen answered.</span>
         
         
         <p>Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.</p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously. But one day you must

         <p>Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk
            of a

         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle

         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr

         <p>He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words
            from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.
         </p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates

         <p>He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering,
            began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he
            screwed up the drum to erase an error.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed around the
            walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air:
            <span ref="horse racing">lord Hastings’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster’s
               _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort’s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, 1866.</span>
            Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds, backing king’s
            colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.
         </p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. _But prompt ventilation of

         <p>Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust
            of
            life. You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?
            Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles,
            the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied
            guts.

         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of

            a nation’s decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength. I

            belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed
            about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely
            would scatter all. A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their
            eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their

         <p>Running after me. No more letters, I hope.</p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—Just one moment.</span>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.</span>
         
         
         <p>Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.</p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the
            honour ofeing the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know that?
            No.
            And do you know why?</span>
         
         
         <p>He frowned sternly on the bright air.</p>
         
         <span class="Stephen">—Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.</span>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—<span ref="Jews in Ireland">Because she never let them in</span>, Mr Deasy said solemnly.</span>
         
         
         <p>A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain
            of
            phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the
            air.
         </p>
         
         <span class="Mr. Deasy">—She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as
            he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That’s why.</span>
         
         
         <p>On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing
            coins.
