            <p>The superior, the very
               reverend John Conmee S. J. reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came
               down the presbytery steps. Five to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was
               that boy’s name again? Dignam. Yes. <span class="reference">_Vere dignum et
                  iustum est._</span> Brother Swan was the person to see. Mr Cunningham’s

            <p>A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled
               some
               notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a
               peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed
               him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.
            </p>
            
            <p> Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long, of soldiers
               and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some
               pauper ward, and of <span class="person">cardinal Wolsey’s</span>
               words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned
               me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards
               him came the wife of <span class="person">Mr David Sheehy M.P.</span></p>
            <span class="said">—Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?</span>
            
            <p>Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably for the
               waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at <span class="reference">Belvedere</span>? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear
               that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be sure
               it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that
               <span class="person">Father Bernard Vaughan</span> would come again
               to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.
            </p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. Iooking so well
               and
               he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call.
            </p>
            <span class="said">—Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.</span>
            
            <p>Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of
               her
               mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in going. He had cleaned his
               teeth, he knew, with <span class="reference">arecanut paste.</span></p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan’s
               droll eyes and cockney voice.

               a

               one think it? Welsh, were they not?

            <p>Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square. Yes:
               they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they good boys at school?
               O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger.
               Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very
               nice name to have.

         </div>
         
         <div class="location" id="FitzgibbonStreet1">
            <p>Father Conmee gave a letter
               from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner
               of Fitzgibbon street.
            </p>
            <span class="said">—But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he
               said.</span> The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: <span class="said">—O,

            <span class="said">—Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee
               said.</span>
            
            <p> Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter to father
               provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father Conmee smiled and
               nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.

            <p>Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk
               facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed
               patent boots, walking <span class="allusion">with grave
                  deportment</span> most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady

            </p>
            
            <p>Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?</p>
            
            <p>Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath
               along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. How did she do?
            </p>
            
            <p>A fine carriage she had. Like <span class="person">Mary, queen of Scots</span>,
               something. And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should
               he say?... such a queenly mien.
            </p>

         <div class="location" id="NorthCircularRoad1">
            
            <p>Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup <span class="reference">free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will
                  (D.V.) speak.</span> The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on
               him to say a few words. But one should be charitable. <span class="reference">Invincible ignorance.</span> They acted according to their lights.
            </p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. It was a
               wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there
               ought to be
            </p>. 
            <p>A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All
               raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian
               brother boys.
            </p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint Joseph’s church,
               Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised his hat to the
               Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now
               it
               was an office or something.

         <div class="location" id="N.StrandRoad1">
            <p>Father Conmee began to walk
               along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the
               doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the
               odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.
            </p>
            <p>He passed
               Grogan’s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful
               catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually happening.
               <span class="reference">Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.
                  Still, an act of perfect contrition.</span></p>
            <p>Father Conmee went by
               Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged.
               They saluted him and were saluted.
            </p>
            <p>Father Conmee passed H. J. O’Neill’s funeral
               establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a
               blade of hay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted
               the constable.
            </p>
            <p>In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee observed
               pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.
            </p>
            
            <p>Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse
               with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking
               and
               staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected
               on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might
               dig
               it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor
               people.

            <p>On Newcomen bridge the very
               reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis Xavier’s church, upper Gardiner street,
               stepped on to an outward bound tram.
            </p>
            
            <p>Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint Agatha’s
               church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.
            </p>
            
            <p>At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked
               to
               traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.
            </p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the
               eye
               of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from
               his other plump glovepalm into his purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that
               the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the
               ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive
               for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.
            </p>
            
            <p>It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had
               finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed. A tiny yawn
               opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses. She raised her small
               gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening
               mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.
            </p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that the awkward
               man
               at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.
            </p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the
               awkward old man who had the shaky head.

         <div class="location" id="AnnesleyBridge1">
            <p>At Annesley bridge the tram
               halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to
               alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out
               with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and
               net
               and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end
               of
               the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice
               <span class="reference">_bless you, my child,_ that they have been absolved,
                  _pray for me._</span> But they had so many worries in life, so many cares,
               poor creatures.

            <p>From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father

            </p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon
               on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission and of the propagation of the
               faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received
               the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night. <span class="allusion">That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des
                  Élus,_</span> seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were millions
               of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.)
               been brought. But they were God’s souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee
               a
               pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.

               <span class="person">Lord Talbot de Malahide</span>,
               immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the
               call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Those were old worldish
               days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.
            </p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of
               the
               book that might be written about jesuit houses and of <span class="person">Mary Rochfort</span>, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of
               Belvedere.
            </p>
            
            <p>A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first
               countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter
               plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her
               confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas
               naturale mulieris,_ with her husband’s brother? She would half confess if she had
               not
               all sinned as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother.
            </p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man’s race
               on
               earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.
            </p>
            
            <p>Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and honoured there.
               He
               bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed
               drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a
               bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.
            </p>
            
            <p>It was a charming day.</p>
            
            <p>The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him
               with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly
               down the wind. _Moutonner,_ the French said. A just and homely word.
            </p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee, <span class="reference">reading his office</span>, watched a
               flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the
               stubble of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the
               cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was
               their rector: his reign was mild.
            </p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. <span class="reference">An ivory bookmark</span> told him the page.
            </p>
            
            <p>Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.</p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee read in secret <span class="reference">_Pater_ and _Ave_</span>
               and crossed his breast. <span class="reference">_Deus in
                  adiutorium._</span></p>
            
            <p>He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to
               <span class="reference">_Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum
                  tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ._</span></p>
            
            <p>A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with
               wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young
               woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging
               twig.
            </p>
            
            <p>Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary. <span class="reference">_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis
                  formidavit cor meum._</span> * * *

            <p>Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine
               coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning
               it
               on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid
               the coffinlid by and came to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade
               to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.
            </p>
            
            <p>Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.</p>
            
            <p>Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing
               his
               blade of hay.
            </p>
            
            <p>Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day. —That’s a fine day, Mr
               Kelleher. —Ay, Corny Kelleher said. —It’s very close, the constable said.
            </p>
            
            <p>Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous
               white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin. —What’s the best news?
               he asked. —I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated
               breath. * * *

            <p>A onelegged sailor
               crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and
               jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his
               doorway, he growled unamiably:

            <p>J. J. O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse
               with
               a visitor.
            </p>
            
            <p>A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap
               held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows,
               sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.
            </p>
            
            <p>He halted and growled angrily: <span class="said">—_For England_... </span>
               Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his
               stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.
            </p>
            
            <p>He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window
               and bayed deeply: <span class="said">—_home and beauty._ </span> The gay
               sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. The blind of the window
               was drawn aside. A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell. A
               plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and
               taut shiftstraps. A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell
               on the path.
            </p>
            
            <p>One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel’s cap,

            <p>Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey, sitting opposite
               Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: <span class="said">—A good job we have that much. Where’s Dilly?</span>
               <span class="said">—Gone to meet father, Maggy said.</span></p>

            <p>A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under
               Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers,
               sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and

            <p>The blond girl in Thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre. Blazes

               <span class="said">—Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.</span>

            <p>Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop,

            <p>Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.</p>
            
            <p>Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower

               nicelooking, is she? The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that
               fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina
               skirt like Susy Nagle’s. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells
               never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won’t keep me here till seven.

                  Yes, sir. I’ll ring them up after five. Only those two, sir, for Belfast and
                  Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go after six if you’re not back. A quarter

            <span class="said">—No, Ned.</span> —He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent
            said, if my memory serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in <span class="reference">Thomas court</span>. —That’s
            right, Ned Lambert said. That’s quite right, sir. —If you will be so kind then, the
            clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps... —Certainly, Ned Lambert said.
            Bring
            the camera whenever you like. I’ll get those bags cleared away from the windows. You
            can

            his
            lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor. From a long face a beard
            and
            gaze hung on a chessboard. —I’m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I
            won’t
            trespass on your valuable time... —You’re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in
            whenever

            pleased
            to have met you. —Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered. He followed his guest
            to
            the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars. With J. J. O’Molloy he
            came
            forth slowly into Mary’s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob
            and
            palmnut meal, O’Connor, Wexford. He stood to read the card in his hand. —The reverend
            Hugh
            C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint Michael’s, Sallins. Nice young chap he
            is.

            you
            were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O’Molloy said. Ned Lambert cracked his fingers
            in the
            air. —God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about <span class="person">the earl of Kildare</span> after he set
            fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? _I’m bloody sorry I did it,_ says he,
            _but I
            declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside._ He mightn’t like it, though.
            What?
            God, I’ll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members
            they
            were all of them, the Geraldines. The horses he passed started nervously under their
            slack
            harness. He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: —Woa, sonny! He
            turned
            to J. J. O’Molloy and asked: —Well, Jack. What is it? What’s the trouble? Wait awhile.
            Hold hard. With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant,
            sneezed loudly. —Chow! he said. Blast you! —The dust from those sacks, J. J. O’Molloy
            said
            politely. —No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your soul...
            night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught... He held his handkerchief
            ready for the coming... —I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do

            see.
            Turn Now On. He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled

            <p>He read where his finger opened. </p>
            <span class="said">_—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the

            <p>Yes. This. Here. Try. </p>

            <p>The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders
               and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she
               turned to him calmly. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._ </p>
            
            <p>Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled
               clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves for prey. Melting
               breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul!_). Armpits’ oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime
               (_her heaving embonpoint!_). Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions!

            <p>An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king’s
               bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor’s court the
               case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion,
               of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court

            </p>
            
            <p>Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains. The
               shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing. He
               raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor. He put his boot on what he had
               spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily
               haired. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr Bloom beheld it. </p>
            
            <p>Mastering his troubled breath, he said: </p>
            <span class="said">—I’ll take this one. </span>
            <span class="said">The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum. —_Sweets of Sin,_ he

            <p>The lacquey by the door of
               Dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the

            </p>
            
            <p>Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries
               of
               the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains. Five shillings. Cosy
               curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five shillings? Going for five
               shillings.
            </p>
            
            <p>The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: <span class="said">—Barang!</span></p>
            
            <p>Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J. A. Jackson,
               W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the
               curve by the College library.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams’s row. He halted near
               his daughter. <span class="said">—It’s time for you, she said.</span>
               <span class="said">—Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus
                  said. Are</span> you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head

            </p>
            
            <p>Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.
               <span class="said">—Stand up straight, girl, he said. You’ll get curvature
                  of the spine.</span> Do you know what you look like?
            </p>
            
            <p>He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping
               his
               underjaw. <span class="said">—Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are
                  looking at you.</span></p>
            
            <p>Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.</p>
            <span class="said">—Did you get any money? Dilly asked.</span>
            <span class="said">—Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in
               Dublin</span> would lend me fourpence. <span class="said">—You got some, Dilly said,
               looking in his eyes.</span>
            <span class="said">—How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his
               cheek.</span>
            
            <p>Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James’s
               street.
            </p>
            <span class="said">—I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house
               now?</span>
            <span class="said">—I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns
               taught you to be so saucy? Here.</span>
            
            <p>He handed her a shilling.</p>
            <span class="said">—See if you can do anything with that, he said.</span>
            <span class="said">—I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.</span>
            <span class="said">—Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You’re like the rest
               of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died.
               But
               wait awhile. You’ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. Low blackguardism!
               I’m going to get rid of you. Wouldn’t care if I was stretched out stiff. He’s dead.
               The man upstairs is dead.</span>
            
            <p>He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.</p>
            <span class="said">—Well, what is it? he said, stopping.</span>
            
            <p>The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.</p>
            <span class="said">—Barang!</span>
            <span class="said">—Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on
               him.</span>
            
            <p>The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly:</p>
            <span class="said">—Bang!</span>
            
            <p>Mr Dedalus stared at him.</p>
            <span class="said">—Watch him, he said. It’s instructive. I wonder will he allow us
               to talk.</span>
            <span class="said">—You got more than that, father, Dilly said.</span>
            <span class="said">—I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I’ll leave
               you all where <span class="reference">Jesus left the jews.</span> Look, there’s all I have. I got two shillings from
               Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.</span>
            
            <p>He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.</p>
            <span class="said">—Can’t you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.</span>
            
            <p>Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.</p>
            <span class="said">—I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in
               O’Connell street. I’ll try this one now.</span>
            <span class="said">—You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.</span>
            <span class="said">—Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of
               milk for yourself and a bun or a something. I’ll be home shortly.</span>
            
            <p>He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.</p>
            
            <p>The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.</p>
            <span class="said">—I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.</span>
            
            <p>The lacquey banged loudly.</p>
            
            <p>Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth
               gently:

            <p>From the sundial towards James’s
               gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson,
               boldly along James’s street,
            </p>
            <p> past Shackleton’s offices.</p>
            <p>Got round him
               all right. How do you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be
               up
               in your other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive.
               Lovely weather we’re having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those farmers are
               always grumbling. I’ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small
               gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion. Terrible,
               terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women
               and children. Most brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous
               combustion. Most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the
               firehose all burst. What I can’t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat
               like that... Now, you’re talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palm oil. Is
               that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say is the
               land of the free. I thought we were bad here.
            </p>
            
            <p>I smiled at him. _America,_ I said quietly, just like that. _What is it? The sweepings
               of every country including our own. Isn’t that true?_ That’s a fact.
            </p>
            
            <p>Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s always someone
               to pick it up.
            </p>
            
            <p>Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy appearance.

               loudly outside Reddy and Daughter’s. Father Cowley brushed his moustache often

            <span class="said">—What’s the best news? Mr Dedalus said. </span><span class="said">—Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I’m barricaded up, Simon,
               with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance. </span><span class="said">—Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it? </span><span class="said">—O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our

               long John to get him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.
               </span><p>He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his
               neck.
            </p>
            <span class="said">—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He’s
               always doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard! </span><p>He put on his glasses and

               Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in
               full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an amble, scratching
               actively behind his coattails. 
            </p>
            
            <p>As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: </p>
            <span class="said">—Hold that fellow with the bad trousers. </span><span class="said">—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said. </span><p>Mr Dedalus eyed with
               cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard’s figure. Then, turning to Father
               Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:
            </p>
            <span class="said">—That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?
               </span><span class="said">—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard
               growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.
               </span><p>He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from
               points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:
            </p>
            <span class="said">—They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow. </span><span class="said">—Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be
               to God he’s not paid yet. </span><span class="said">—And how is that _basso

            <p>Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth a deep note.</p>
            <span class="said">—Aw! he said. </span><span class="said">—That’s the style, Mr
               Dedalus said, nodding to its drone. </span><span class="said">—What about that?
               Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What? </span><p>He turned to both.</p>

            <p>Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air. </p>
            <span class="said">—What’s that? Martin Cunningham said. </span>
            
            <p>All turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the cool shadow
               of
               the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns
               in
               sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not
               quickly. In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.
            </p>
            <span class="said">—What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up
               the staircase.</span>
            <span class="said">—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland,
               John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.</span> * * * 
            <p>As they trod across the
               thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines:
            </p>
            <span class="said">—Parnell’s brother. There in the corner. </span>
            
            <p>They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and
               gaze
               hung intently down on a chessboard.
            </p>
            <span class="said">—Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.</span>
            <span class="said">—Yes, Mulligan said. That’s John Howard, his brother, our city
               marshal.</span>
            
            <p>John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again
               to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under its screen, his eyes
               looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.
            </p>
            <span class="said">—I’ll take a _mélange,_ Haines said to the waitress.</span>
            <span class="said">—Two _mélanges,_ Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones
               and butter and some cakes as well.</span></div>

            <p>Haines opened his newbought book. </p>

            <p>The onelegged sailor growled at

            <span class="said">—You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.
               Wandering Ængus I call him. </span><span class="said">—I am sure he has an _idée

               I
               am speculating what it would be likely to be. Such persons always have.
               </span><p>Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.</p>
            <span class="said">—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He
               will never capture the Attic note. <span class="reference">The note of Swinburne</span>, of all poets, <span class="reference">the white
                  death and the ruddy birth.</span> That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet. The joy of
               creation... </span><span class="said">—Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding
               curtly. I see. I tackled him this morning on belief. There was something on his mind,
               I saw. It’s rather interesting because <span class="person">professor Pokorny of Vienna</span> makes an
               interesting point out of that. </span><p>Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the
               waitress come. He helped her to unload her tray.
            </p>
            <span class="said">—He can find no <span class="reference">trace of hell in ancient Irish myth</span>, Haines said, amid
               the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of
               retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does he write
               anything for your movement? </span><p>He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise
               through the whipped cream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered
               butter over its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.
            </p>
            <span class="said">—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write
               something in ten years. </span><span class="said">—Seems a long way off, Haines said,
               thoughtfully lifting his spoon. Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.
               </span><p>He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup. </p>
            <span class="said">—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don’t
               want to be imposed on. </span><p>Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed

            <p>Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s
               Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan’s, late
               Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street
               dawdling. It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs
               Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and
               sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s. And
               they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and
               sighing.
            </p>
            
            <p>After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him. He
               stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their
               props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently. <span class="reference">Myler Keogh,
                  Dublin’s pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett</span>, the Portobello bruiser, for a
               purse of fifty sovereigns. Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh,
               that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance, soldiers
               half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on his left turned as he
               turned. That’s me in mourning. When is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming
               thing is all over. He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his
               cap awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the
               image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots
               that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out
               of
               him for one time he found out.
            </p>
            
            <p>Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going for strength
               was <span class="person">Fitzsimons</span>. One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle
               of next week, man. But the best pucker for science was <span class="person">Jem Corbet</span> before Fitzsimons
               knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.
            </p>
            
            <p>In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair
               of
               kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the
               time.

            <p>No Sandymount tram.</p>
            
            <p>Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.
               His
               collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming stud was too small for
               the
               buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I’m
               not
               going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice
               I’m in mourning? Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight. Then they’ll
               all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s name.
            </p>
            
            <p> His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking
               over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into
               the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.
            </p>
            
            <p>Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how
               to
               get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking. How was
               that?

               the shaded door of Kavanagh’s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness
               towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right
               Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, <span class="reference">G. C. V. O.</span>, passed Micky Anderson’s all

               Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford,
               seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the
               pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming _soubrette,_

               poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G.
               Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the
               D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal
               equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the
               chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes’s street Dilly
               Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal’s first French primer, saw
               sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare.

            <p>John Henry Menton, filling the
               doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold
               hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg
               of
               <span class="person">King Billy’s horse</span> pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from
               under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding,
               he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The
               honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At
               Ponsonby’s corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons
               halted behind him, E.L.Y.’S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite
               Pigott’s music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c, gaily
               apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost’s
               wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks
               to the refrain of <span class="allusion">_My girl’s a Yorkshire girl._</span></p>
            
            <p>Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders’ skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue
               tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge. His hands
               in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold
               admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. As they drove along
               Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the
               programme of music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland
               laddies blared and drumthumped after the _cortège_:

               cap
               with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on
               his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer’s hospital, drove
               with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind stripling
