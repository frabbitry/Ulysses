            <p>Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
               carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in
               after him, curving his height with care.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Come on, Simon.</span>
            
            <span class="said">After you, Mr Bloom said.</span>
            
            
            <p>Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:
               
            </p>
            <span class="said">Yes, yes.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.</span>
            
            
            <p>Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to
               after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm
               through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow
               at the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman
               peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she
               was passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad
               to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them.
               Huggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he’d
               wake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming
               making the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know
               who will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the
               nails and the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same
               after. Unclean job.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am
               sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better
               shift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:
               then horses’ hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and
               swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of
               the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.
               At walking pace.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
               passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road . Quicker. The wheels
               rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook
               rattling in the doorframes.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.</span>
            
            
            <p>Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.</p>
            
            <span class="said">That’s a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died
               out.</span>
            
            
            <p>All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by
               passers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the
               smoother road past  Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,
               clad in mourning, a wide hat.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Who is that?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Your son and heir.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.</span>
            
            
            <p>The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway
               before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back
               to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus
               fell back, saying:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Was that Mulligan cad with him? His _fidus Achates_!</span>
            
            <span class="said">No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.</span>
            
            <span class="said">—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
               faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump
               of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.</span></div>

            bottleworks: Dodder bridge.
            
            Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls
            the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing
            in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the
            landlady’s two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.
            Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife
            ironing his back. Thinks he’ll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they
            are. About six hundred per cent profit.
            
            <span class="said">He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a
               contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks
               all over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll
               make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother
               or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a
               gate. I’ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.</span>
            
            
            <p>He cried above the clatter of the wheels:

            <span class="said">—I won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper’s
               son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M’Swiney’s. Not likely.</span>
            
            
            <p>He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power’s mild
               face and Martin Cunningham’s eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy
               selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If
               little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house.
               Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange
               feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that
               morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs
               at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning
               up. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us
               a touch, Poldy. God, I’m dying for it. How life begins.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her.
               I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent.
               Learn German too.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Are we late? Mr Power asked.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.</span>
            
            
            <p>Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping
               Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she’s a dear girl. Soon be a
               woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.
               Life, life.

            <p>
               The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.</span>
            
            <span class="said">He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him. Do
               you follow me?</span>
            
            
            <p>He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away
               crustcrumbs from under his thighs.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power
               said.</span>
            
            
            <p>All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
               leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward
               and said:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Unless I’m greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?</span>
            
            <span class="said">It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.</span>
            
            
            <p>Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite
               clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.
            </p>
            
            Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.
            
            <span class="said">After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of
               his beard gently.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.</span>
            
            <span class="said">And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.</span>
            
            <span class="said">At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.</span>
            
            <span class="said">I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he’d try to come.</span>
            
            
            <p>The carriage halted short.
               
            </p>
            <span class="said">What’s wrong?</span>

               colander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.

            <span class="said">The weather is changing, he said quietly.</span>
            
            <span class="said">A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There’s the sun again coming
               out.</span>
            
            
            <p>Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled
               a mute curse at the sky.

            <span class="said">It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.</span>
            
            <span class="said">We’re off again.</span>
            
            
            <p>The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed
               gently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.

            <span class="said">Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking
               him off to his face.</span>
            
            <span class="said">O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear
               him, Simon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. _His singing of that simple
               ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the
               whole course of my experience._</span>
            
            <span class="said">Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He’s dead nuts on that. And the
               retrospective arrangement.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech? Martin Cunningham asked.</span>
            
            <span class="said">I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?</span>
            
            <span class="said">In the paper this morning.</span>
            
            
            <p>Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change
               for her.

            <span class="said">No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.</span>
            
            
            <p>Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
               deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what
               Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s? no, Sexton,
               Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.

            <p>Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
               hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?
               Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes
               feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am
               just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body
               getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes
               that? I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh
               falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders.

            <span class="said">O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It’s a good
               idea, you see...</span>
            
            <span class="said">Are you going yourself?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the
               county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the
               chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.</span>

            <span class="said">Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on

            <span class="said">For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished
               him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
               on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is.....</span>
            
            <span class="said">And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
               saving his son’s life.</span>
            
            
            <p>A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand.</p>

            <span class="said">Isn’t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.</span>

            <span class="said">Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh.
               Many a good one he told himself.</span>
            
            <span class="said">The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his

               and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this.

            <p>The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,
               rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the
               trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain
               gestures on the air.

            <p>The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put
               out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with
               his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.

               Change that soap now. Mr Bloom’s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
               and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.
               He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand
               still held.

            <p>Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It’s all the same.
               Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.
               Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and
               fruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.
               Dogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
               walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took
               out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.

            <p>A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,
               dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a
               granite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.

            <p>Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at

            <p>Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,
               hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl’s face stained with dirt
               and tears, holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to
               cry. Fish’s face, bloodless and livid.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So
               much dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First
               the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy
               followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the
               brother-in-law.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>All walked after.</p>
            
            
            <p>Martin Cunningham whispered:</p>
            
            <span class="said">I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.</span>

            <span class="said">O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?</span>
            
            <p>
               He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed
               towards the cardinal’s mausoleum. Speaking.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.</span>
            
            <span class="said">I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily
               mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.</span>
            
            <span class="said">How many children did he leave?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Five. Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s.</span>
            
            <span class="said">A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.</span>
            
            <span class="said">A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.</span>
            
            
            <p>Has the laugh at him now.</p>
            
            
            <p>He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had
               outlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must
               outlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the
               world. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you’ll soon follow
               him. For 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Hindu</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Hinduism</span></div> widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who
               knows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on
               a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in
               the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of
               hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the
               substance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,
               waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground:
               and lie no more in her warm bed.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven’t
               seen you for a month of Sundays.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Never better. How are all in Cork’s own town?</span>
            
            <span class="said">I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert
               said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.</span>
            
            <span class="said">And how is Dick, the solid man?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.</span>
            
            <span class="said">By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,
               pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the
               insurance is cleared up.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother. John Henry Menton is
               behind. He put down his name for a quid.</span>
            
            <span class="said">I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought
               to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.</span>
            
            <span class="said">How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.</span>
            
            
            <p>They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood
               behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and
               at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was
               he there when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last
               moment and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe
               
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">three shillings</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">currency</span></div> to O’Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the
               coffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?
            </p>
            
            
            <p>After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened
               light. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow
               candles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a
               wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners
               knelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the
               font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
               from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black
               hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.

            <p>A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a
               door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with
               one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s
               belly. Who’ll read the book? I, said the rook

            <p>They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book
               with a fluent croak.

               and shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As

               a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in
               childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls
               with little sparrows’ breasts. All the year round he prayed the same

            Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
            coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny
            Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All
            followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom
            came last folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at
            the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal
            wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt
            boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.

               impressive I must say.</span>
            
            
            <p>Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.</p>
            
            
            <p>Mr Kernan said with solemnity:</p>

               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">I am the resurrection and the life</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">religion</span></div>_. That touches a man’s inmost
               heart.</span>
            
            <span class="said">It does, Mr Bloom said.</span>
            
            
            <p>Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two
               with his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.
               Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood
               every day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of
               them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn
               the thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you
               are dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves.
               Come forth, 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Lazarus</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Christianity</span></div>! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last
               day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and
               the rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning.

            <p>Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Everything went off A1, he said. What?</span>
            
            
            <p>He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman’s shoulders. With
               your tooraloom tooraloom.
               
            </p>
            <span class="said">As it should be, Mr Kernan said.</span>
            
            <span class="said">What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.</span>
            
            
            <p>Mr Kernan assured him.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I
               know his face.</span>
            
            
            <p>Ned Lambert glanced back.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the
               soprano. She’s his wife.</span>
            
            <span class="said">O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven’t seen her for some
               time. She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen
               seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown. And a good
               armful she was.</span>
            
            
            <p>He looked behind through the others.</p>
            
            <span class="said">What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn’t he in the stationery
               line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.</span>
            
            
            <p>Ned Lambert smiled.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s. A traveller for blottingpaper.</span>
            
            <span class="said">In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">coon</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">racial slur</span></div> like
               that for? She had plenty of game in her then.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.</span>
            
            
            <p>John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead.</p>
            
            
            <p>The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the</p>
            grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.
            
            <span class="said">John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.</span>
            
            <p>
               Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">I am come to pay you another visit.</span>
            
            <span class="said">My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don’t want
               your custom at all.</span>
            
            
            <p>Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
               Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?</span>
            
            <span class="said">I did not, Martin Cunningham said.</span>
            
            
            <p>They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The
               caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke
               in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
               evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for
               Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After
               traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the
               drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was
               blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.</span>
            
            
            <p>The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He
               resumed:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like
               the man_, says he. _That’s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.</span>
            
            
            <p>Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher,
               accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as
               he walked.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.</span>
            
            <span class="said">I know, Hynes said. I know that.</span>
            
            <span class="said">To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It’s pure
               goodheartedness: damn the thing else.</span>
            
            
            <p>Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk. All want to be on
               good terms with him. Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort.
               Keys: like Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout
               checks. _Habeas corpus_. I must see about that ad after the funeral.
               Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she
               disturbed me writing to Martha? Hope it’s not chucked in the dead
               letter office. Be the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That’s
               the first sign when the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross.
               Silver threads among the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the
               gumption to propose to any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard.
               Dangle that before her. It might thrill her first. Courting death.
               Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about. The
               shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be
               a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy
               man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark. Will o’
               the wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at
               all. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to
               make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a
               pitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. Still they’d
               kiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards.
               Learn anything if taken young. You might pick up a young widow here.
               Men like that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In
               the midst of death we are in life. Both ends meet. Tantalising for the
               poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving. Gnawing their
               vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting to do it at the window.
               Eight children he has anyway.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field
               after field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing.
               Sitting or kneeling you couldn’t. Standing? His head might come up some
               day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed
               the ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim
               grass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so
               it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant
               poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic
               Gardens are just over there. It’s the blood sinking in the earth gives
               new life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.
               Every man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure,
               invaluable for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William
               Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds
               thirteen and six. With thanks.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,
               nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot
               quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a
               tallowy kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing
               out of them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever
               they are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically.
               Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply
               swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little
               seaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of
               power seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at
               life. Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one
               about the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11
               p.m. (closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the
               men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what’s
               in fashion. A juicy pear or ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep
               out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.
               Gravediggers in _
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Hamlet</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Tragedy</span></div>_. Shows the profound knowledge of the human
               heart. Daren’t joke about the dead for two years at least. _De mortuis
               nil nisi prius_. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral.
               Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live
               longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.
               
            </p>
            <span class="said">How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.</span>
            
            
            <p>The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to
               trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole,
               stepping with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin
               and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Burying him. We come to bury Cæsar. His ides of March or June. He
               doesn’t know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot
               over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I’d like to know? Now I’d
               give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never
               dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he
               could. Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though
               he could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too.
               First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Robinson Crusoe</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Author</span></div> was
               true to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a
               Thursday if you come to look at it.
               
               O, poor Robinson Crusoe!
               How could you possibly do so?
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of
               them all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could
               invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that
               way. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’s.
               They’re so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the
               holy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one
               coffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible
               even in the earth. The Irishman’s house is his coffin. Embalming in
               catacombs, mummies the same idea.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.
               Twelve. I’m thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.
               Death’s number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn’t in the
               chapel, that I’ll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had
               one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he
               was once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey
               suit of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It’s dyed. His wife I forgot he’s
               not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for
               him.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the
               gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Pause.</p>
            
            
            <p>If we were all suddenly somebody else.</p>
            
            
            <p>Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they
               say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The
               boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in
               the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly
               caretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which
               will go next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It’s the moment
               you feel. Must be damned unpleasant. Can’t believe it at first. Mistake
               must be: someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I
               haven’t yet. Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering
               around you. Would you like to see a priest? Then rambling and
               wandering. Delirium all you hid all your life. The death struggle. His
               sleep is not natural. Press his lower eyelid. Watching is his nose
               pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow. Pull the
               pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed. Devil in
               that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman. Dying to embrace
               her in his shirt. Last act of _Lucia. Shall I nevermore behold thee_?
               Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit: forget you.
               Don’t forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even
               Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one
               after the other.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you’re well and
               not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the
               fire of purgatory.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do
               when you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy’s warning.
               Near you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma,
               poor mamma, and little Rudy.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in
               on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all
               the time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of
               course. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some
               law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a
               telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of
               distress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well
               to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.</p>
            
            
            <p>The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of
               it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves
               without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make
               its way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground,
               he traversed the dismal fields.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he
               knows them all. No: coming to me.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your
               christian name? I’m not sure.</span>
            
            <span class="said">L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M’Coy’s name too. He
               asked me to.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the _Freeman_ once.</span>
            
            
            <p>So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good
               idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He
               died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads.
               Charley, you’re my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does
               no harm. I saw to that, M’Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave
               him under an obligation: costs nothing
            </p>.
            
            <span class="said">And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was
               over there in the...</span>
            
            
            <p>He looked around.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?</span>
            
            <span class="said">M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don’t know who he is. Is that his
               name?</span>
            
            
            <p>He moved away, looking about him.</p>
            
            <span class="said">No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!</span>
            
            
            <p></p>Didn’t hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all
            the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good
            Lord, what became of him?
            
            
            <p>A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.</p>
            
            <span class="said">O, excuse me!</span>
            
            
            <p>He stepped aside nimbly.</p>
            
            
            <p>Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.
               A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested
               their spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped
               his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The
               gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards
               the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One
               bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his
               mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.
               Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord.
               The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.
               Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For
               yourselves just.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying
               at whiles to read a name on a tomb.
               
            </p>
            <span class="said">Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said. We have time.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Let us, Mr Power said.</span>
            
            
            <p>They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr
               Power’s blank voice spoke:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled
               with stones. That one day he will come again.</span>
            
            
            <p>Hynes shook his head.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Parnell will never come again, he said. He’s there, all that was
               mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.</span>
            
            
            <p>Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,
               broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,
               old Ireland’s hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on
               some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does
               anybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a
               coalshoot. Then lump them together to save time. All souls’ day.
               Twentyseventh I’ll be at his grave. Ten 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">shillings</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">currency</span></div> for the gardener. He
               keeps it free of weeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with his
               shears clipping. Near death’s door. Who passed away. Who departed this
               life. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the shove, all of
               them. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they told you what
               they were. So and So, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid
               five shillings in the pound. Or a woman’s with her saucepan. I cooked
               good Irish stew. Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that
               poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest
               the protestants put it. Old Dr Murren’s. The great physician called him
               home. Well it’s God’s acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly
               plastered and painted. Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the
               _Church Times._ Marriage ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths
               hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better value that for the money.
               Still, the flowers are more poetical. The other gets rather tiresome,
               never withering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the
               wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.
               Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even
               sadder. Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen
               matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be
               sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was
               dedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this
               infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket
               of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the
               boy. 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Apollo</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Greek God</span></div> that was.

            <p>How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed.
               As you are now so once were we.
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the
               voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in
               the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.

            <p>He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he
               goes.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the
               pebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey
               alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.
               Good hidingplace for treasure.

            <p>One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones
               clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat
               gone bad. Well and what’s cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that

               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Voyages in China</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Novel</span></div>_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a
               corpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the
               other firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the
               plague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to
               ashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by
               birds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See
               your whole life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can’t
               bury in the air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news
               go about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication.
               We learned that from them. Wouldn’t be surprised. Regular square feed
               for them. Flies come before he’s well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They
               wouldn’t care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of
               corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.

            <p>The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again.
               Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I
               was here was Mrs Sinico’s funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills.
               And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I
               read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running
               gravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after
               death. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after
               death. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like
               that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and
               feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their
               maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds:
               warm fullblooded life.

            <p>Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,
               commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.
               Mat Dillon’s long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl,
               cigars, the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got
               his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside
               him. Pure fluke of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to
               me. Hate at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the
               lilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are
               by.
            </p>
            
            Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.
            
            <span class="said">Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.</span>
            
            
            <p>They stopped.</p>
            
            <span class="said"> Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.</span>
            
            <p>
               John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.</span>
            
            
            <p>John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed
               the nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head
               again.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">It’s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.</span>
            
            
            <p>John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Thank you, he said shortly.</span>
            
            
            <p>They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a
               few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin
               could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his
               seeing it.
