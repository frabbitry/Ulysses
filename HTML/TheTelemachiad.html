            <h2>About the Section</h2>
            <p>"The Telemachiad," the first section of <i>Ulysses</i>, includes three
                chapters, which use three settings, as listed on the side of the page. The three
                chapters of "The Telemachiad" are </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href = "Telemachus.html">Telemachus</a></li>
                <li><a href = "Nestor.html">Nestor</a></li>
                <li><a href = "Proteus.html">Proteus</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Considering the homeric parallel, the Telemachiad focuses on Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, and these first three chapters serve as introductions to the larger narrative arcs of <i>Ulysses</i>. On a simpler level, in "The Telemachiad," the day June 16, 1904, when the book is set, begins.</p>
