            <h2>About the Section</h2>
            <p>"The Telemachiad," the first section of <i>Ulysses</i>, includes three
                chapters, which use three settings, as listed on the side of the page. The three
                chapters of "The Telemachiad" are </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href = "Telemachus.html">Telemachus</a></li>
                <li><a href = "Nestor.html">Nestor</a></li>
                <li><a href = "Proteus.html">Proteus</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Considering the homeric parallel, the Telemachiad focuses on Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, and these first three chapters serve as introductions to the larger narrative arcs of <i>Ulysses</i>. On a simpler level, in "The Telemachiad," the day June 16, 1904, when the book is set, begins.</p>
            <h2>Most Common Allusions</h2>
            <p>In "The Telemachiad," the most common allusions are allusions to Stephen Dedalus (in the sense that Stephen Dedalus, a character in <i>Ulysses</i>, is referenced from one of Joyce's other works, in which he is also a character, the semi-autobiographical <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>), the Bible, and Christianity.</p>
            <p>Stephen Dedalus was referenced 10 times, the Bible was referenced 9 times, and Christianity was referenced 9 times.</p>
            <p>There were 208 total allusions coded in "The Telemachiad."</p>
            <h2>Map</h2>
            <p>The following map is a map of the locations of the "Telemachiad" section. You can see the three locations of this section, Sandycove, Sandymount Strand, and Dalkey, Dublin Bay, featured as green dots on the map. They are also listed to the side, even though they - as of now - remain uncompleted. Due to time constraints we were unable to create separate web pages for every location, but hopefully given more time the locations on the left will each be given their own web page explaining their specific significance.</p>
            <img src="Telemachiad.png" usemap="#telemachiad_map" alt = "Telemachiad"/>
                <map name="telemachiad_map">
                    <area alt="Sandymount Strand" title="Sandymount Strand" href="SandymountStrand.html" coords="190,189,215,213" shape="rect"/>
                        <area alt="Sandycove" title="Sandycove" href="Sandycove.html" coords="539,354,563,378" shape="rect"/>
                            <area alt="Dalkey, Dublin Bay" title="Dalkey, Dublin Bay" href="DalkeyDublinBay.html" coords="580,400,619,435" shape="rect"/>
                </map>
            <p>The following heatmap displays the concentration of allusions, weighted by the most common allusions. You can see that the bulk of the allusions were made in the locations nearer to Dublin, because the area around Dublin is a lighter purple color than the rest of the map.</p>

            <h2>Network Graph</h2>
            <p>The following network graph ties allusions to locations in "The Telemachiad."</p>
<div class = "center"><a href = "Telemachiad.svg"><div class="img-magnifier-container">
                <img id="telemachiadzoom" src="Telemachiad.svg" width="600" height="400" alt="Telemachiad"/>
            </div></a></div>
            <p>If you zoom in on the picture using the magnifier, you can see that there are clusters of allusions centered around the three settings included in "The Telemachiad," Sandycove, Sandymount Strand, and Dalkey, Dublin Bay. These locations are unique because, unlike most of the locations included in <i>Ulysses</i>, these are outside of the city of Dublin. It is also interesting to note that there aren't very many shared allusions between the three locations. Sandycove is connected to Sandymount Strand because they both include allusions to Christianity, and Dalkey, Dublin Bay is connected to Sandymount Strand for the same reason, but Sandymount Strand and Sandycove do not share any other allusions. The clusters, as you can see on the graph, are somewhat isolated. The circles designating allusions are sized by closeness centrality, which means that the allusions "closest" to the locations are the largest. Closeness is determined by how strongly correlated the allusion is with the location. Moreover, the circles designating allusions are colored according to degree, which means that the allusions that are referenced the most often and in the most locations are lighter-colored than the allusions that are referenced fewer and in fewer places. As you can see, some of the most commonly referenced allusions, such as Christianity or the Bible, are some of the lightest colored circles.</p>
