            <p>A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel. He curled them between his palms
               at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips. A
               sweetened boy’s breath. Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.

            <p>All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round at his
               classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware
               of
               my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the

            <p>Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench whispered. Yes.
               They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. All. With envy he watched their
               faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with
               tea
               and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">—Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.</span>
            
            
            <p>The words troubled their gaze.</p>
            
            <span class="said">—How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.</span>

               to
               pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A jester at the court of his master,
               indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master’s praise. Why had they chosen all
               that part? Not wholly for the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like
               any
               other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.

            <p>A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.
               He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:

            <p>Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook. His
               tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty
               glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain
               of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail’s bed.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>He held out his copybook. The word _Sums_ was written on the headline. Beneath were
               sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.
               Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.

            <p>Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s bed. Yet
               someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart. But for her the race
               of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had
               loved his weak watery blood drained from her own. Was that then real?

               an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampled
               underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a
               heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless
               bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped
               and scraped.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by algebra that
               Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather. Sargent peered askance through his
               slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball
               and calls from the field.

            <p>In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word of help his
               hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind
               his dull skin. _Amor matris:_ subjective and objective genitive. With her weak blood
               and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling
               bands.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My childhood bends beside
               me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly. Mine is far and his secret
               as
               our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets
               weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The sum was done.</p>
            
            <span class="said">—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.</span>

            <p>He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back
               to
               his bench.
            </p>

            <p>In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.</p>
            
            <span class="said">—Sargent!</span>
            
            <span class="said">—Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.</span>
            
            
            <p>He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where
               sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away
               stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When he had reached the schoolhouse
               voices again contending called to him. He turned his angry white moustache.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">—What is it now? he cried continually without listening.</span>
            
            <span class="said">—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen

            <p>And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly:</p>
            
            <span class="said">—What is the matter? What is it now?</span>
            
            
            <p>Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him,
               the
               garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.
               As on the first day he bargained with me here.

               and

               heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and
               this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and this, the

            <p>Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too of beauty
               and
               of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.
