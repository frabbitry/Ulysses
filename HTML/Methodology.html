    <h2>Research Question</h2>
        <p>If you've ever encountered <i>Ulysses</i> before, you'll know that it's kind of a monster of a book. It's long. It's hard to read. There's a lot going on with it. It would be impossible to analyze everything that there is to analyze about this book during the course of a semester, so we decided to focus on one aspect of <i>Ulysses</i>: how Joyce recreates the city of Dublin through his novel. </p>
