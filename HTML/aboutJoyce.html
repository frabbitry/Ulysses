        <h2 class = "center">About James Joyce</h2>
        <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce">James Joyce</a>, 1882 - 1941, was an Irish author who, while arguably one of the most influential authors of the 20th century, is most well-known for his contributions to the modernist avant-garde movement. His most famous works include <i>Ulysses</i>, <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, <i>Dubliners</i>, and <i>Finnegan's Wake</i></p>
        <p>As part of the Modernist movement, he is known for, among other things, using experimental literary styles, probably most notably stream-of-consciousness. Moreover, also as a hallmark of the Modernist movement, the references Joyce uses in his work are extensive.</p>
        <h2 class = "center">About Ulysses</h2>
        <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)"><i>Ulysses</i></a> is a novel by James Joyce, considered by many to be one of the most influential works of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>It employs a stream-of-consciousness style and includes many references. It chronicles a day in the life of Mr. Leopold Bloom as he moves about Dublin, Ireland; however, Bloom's day-long journey also parallels <i>The Odyssey</i> by Homer.</p>
