            <p>Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
               lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow
               dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild
               morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">_
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Introibo ad altare Dei</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Catholic Mass</span></div>_.</span>
            
            
            <p>Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:</p>
            
            <span class="said">Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">jesuit</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">religious group</span></div>!</span>
            
            
            <p>Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about
               and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
               awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent
               towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
               and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
               his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
               gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
               untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
               bowl smartly.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Back to barracks! he said sternly.</span>
            
            
            <p>He added in a preacher’s tone:</p>
            
            <span class="said">For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul
               and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One
               moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.</span>
            
            
            <p>He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
               awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and
               there with gold points. 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Chrysostomos</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Saint</span></div>. Two strong shrill whistles
               answered through the calm.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off
               the current, will you?</span>
            
            
            <p>He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering
               about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and
               sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.
               A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!</span>
            
            
            <p>He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
               laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
               halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
               he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
               lathered cheeks and neck.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.</p>
            
            <span class="said">My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a
               
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Hellenic</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Greek</span></div> ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We
               must go to 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Athens</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Greek</span></div>. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out
               twenty quid?</span>
            
            
            <p>He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:</p>
            
            <span class="said">Will he come? The jejune 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">jesuit</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Religious Group</span></div>!</span>
            
            
            <p>Ceasing, he began to shave with care.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Yes, my love?</span>
            
            <span class="said">How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.</p>
            
            <span class="said">God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Saxon</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">ethnicity</span></div>. He thinks
               you’re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money
               and indigestion. Because he comes from 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Oxford</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">place</span></div>. You know, Dedalus, you
               have the real 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Oxford</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">place</span></div> manner. He can’t make you out. O, my name for you
               is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.</span>
            
            
            <p>He shaved warily over his chin.</p>
            
            <span class="said">He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is
               his guncase?</span>
            
            <span class="said">A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?</span>
            
            <span class="said">I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark
               with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
               black panther. You saved men from drowning. I’m not a hero, however. If
               he stays on here I am off.</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down
               from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Scutter! he cried thickly.</span>
            
            
            <p>He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper
               pocket, said:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
               dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.
               Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.
               You can almost taste it, can’t you?</span>
            
            
            <p>He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
               oakpale hair stirring slightly.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">—God! he said quietly. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet
               mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. _Epi oinopa
               ponton_. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them
               in the original. 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">_Thalatta! Thalatta!_</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Greek</span></div> She is our great sweet mother.
               Come and look.</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked
               down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
               Kingstown.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.</span>
            
            
            <p>He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s
               face.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That’s why she won’t
               let me have anything to do with you.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.</span>
            
            <span class="said">You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother
               asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I’m
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown"> hyperborean</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Race of Giants</span></div> as much as you. But to
               think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and
               pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you....</span>
            
            
            <p>He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant
               smile curled his lips.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest
               mummer of them all!</span>
            
            
            <p>He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.</p>
            
            
            <p>Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
               his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.
               Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently,
               in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within
               its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,
               her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
               wetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a
               great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and
               skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had
               stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had
               torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt
               and a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?</span>
            
            <span class="said">They fit well enough, Stephen answered.</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.</p>
            
            <span class="said">—The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God
               knows what 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">poxy bowsy</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">low life</span></div> left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair
               stripe, grey. You’ll look spiffing in them. I’m not joking, Kinch. You
               look damn well when you’re dressed.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Thanks, Stephen said. I can’t wear them if they are grey.</span>
            
            <span class="said">He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.
               Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey
               trousers.</span>
            
            
            <p>He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
               smooth skin.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
               smokeblue mobile eyes.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
               says you have g. p. i. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.
               General paralysis of the insane!</span>
            
            
            <p>He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings
               abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips
               laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized
               all his strong wellknit trunk.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by
               a crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this
               face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her
               all right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.
               Lead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.</span>
            
            
            <p>Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.</p>
            
            <span class="said">—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If
               Wilde were only alive to see you!</span>
            
            
            <p>Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:</p>
            
            <span class="said">It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him
               round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he
               had thrust them.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.
               God knows you have more spirit than any of them.</span>
            
            
            <p>Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The
               cold steel pen.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap
               downstairs and touch him for a guinea. He’s stinking with money and
               thinks you’re not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling
               jalap to 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Zulus</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">African Tribe</span></div> or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and
               I could only work together we might do something for the island.
               Hellenise it.</span>
            
            
            <p>Cranly’s arm. His arm.</p>
            
            <span class="said">And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I’m the only one
               that knows what you are. Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up
               your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll
               bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave

            <p>Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms. Palefaces:
               they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall

               ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the
               table, with trousers down at heels, chased by
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="allusion"><span class="dropdown"> Ades of Magdalen</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Oscar Wilde</span></div> with the

            <p>Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf
               gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower
               on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.

            <span class="said">Let him stay, Stephen said. There’s nothing wrong with him except at
               night.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I’m
               quite frank with you. What have you against me now?</span>
            
            
            <p>They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on
               the water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm
               quietly.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said"> Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don’t remember anything.</span>
            
            
            <p>He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,
               fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of
               anxiety in his eyes.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:</p>
            
            <span class="said">Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s
               death?</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:</p>
            
            <span class="said">What? Where? I can’t remember anything. I remember only ideas and
               sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?</span>
            
            <span class="said">You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get
               more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the
               drawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.</span>
            
            <span class="said">You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is
               beastly dead._</span>
            
            
            <p>A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck
               Mulligan’s cheek.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?</span>
            
            
            <p>He shook his constraint from him nervously.</p>
            
            <span class="said">And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw
               only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and
               Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It’s a beastly
               thing and nothing else. It simply doesn’t matter. You wouldn’t kneel
               down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why?
               Because you have the cursed 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">jesuit</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Religious Group</span></div> strain in you, only it’s injected
               the wrong way. To me it’s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes
               are not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks
               buttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it’s over. You crossed her
               last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like
               some hired mute from 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Lalouette’s</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Mute</span></div>. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I
               didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.</span>
            
            
            <p>He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping
               wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.</p>
            
            <span class="said">O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.</span>
            
            
            <p>He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,
               gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now
               grew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he
               felt the fever of his cheeks.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>A voice within the tower called loudly:</p>
            
            <span class="said">Are you up there, Mulligan?</span>
            
            <span class="said">I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.</span>
            
            
            <p>He turned towards Stephen and said:</p>
            
            <span class="said">Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,
               Kinch, and come on down. The 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Sassenach</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">English</span></div> wants his morning rashers.</span>
            
            
            <p>His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level
               with the roof:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Don’t mope over it all day, he said. I’m inconsequent. Give up the
               moody brooding.</span>
            
            
            <p>His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
               the stairhead:
               
               
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown"> And no more turn aside and brood

            </p>
            
            
            <p>Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the
               stairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of
               water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the
               dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the
               harpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words
               shimmering on the dim tide.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in
               deeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus’
               song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.
               Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and
               pity I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For
               those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Where now?</p>
            
            
            <p>Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,
               a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the
               sunny window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing
               in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he
               sang:

               And no more turn aside and brood.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his
               brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had
               approached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,
               roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely
               fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s
               shirts.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its
               loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,
               bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On
               me alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the
               tortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all
               prayed on their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. _Liliata
               rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum
               chorus excipiat._
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!</p>
            
            
            <p>No, mother! Let me be and let me live.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Kinch ahoy!</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the
               staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,
               heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is
               apologising for waking us last night. It’s all right.</span>
            
            <span class="said">I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Do, for 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Jesus</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Christianity</span></div>’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our
               sakes.</span>
            
            
            <p>His head disappeared and reappeared.</p>
            
            <span class="said">—I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch
               him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.</span>
            
            <span class="said">I get paid this morning, Stephen said.</span>
            
            <span class="said">The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.</span>
            
            <span class="said">If you want it, Stephen said.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have
               a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent
               sovereigns.</span>
            
            
            <p>He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of
               tune with a Cockney accent:
               
               
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown"> O, won’t we have a merry time,

            </p>
            
            
            <p>Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,
               forgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it
               there all day, forgotten friendship?
            </p>
            
            
            <p>He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
               smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.
               So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now
               and yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form
               moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
               yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
               from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
               coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the
               hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open
               the inner doors.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Have you the key? a voice asked.</span>
            
            <span class="said"> Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m choked!</span>
            
            
            <p>He howled, without looking up from the fire:</p>
            
            <span class="said">Kinch!</span>
            
            <span class="said">It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.</span>
            
            
            <p>The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been
               set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the
               doorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and
               sat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
               him. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set
               them down heavily and sighed with relief.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a
               word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.
               Haines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy
               gifts. Where’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk.</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
               the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.</span>
            
            <span class="said">We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s a lemon in the
               locker.</span>
            
            <span class="said">O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove
               milk.</span>
            
            
            <p>Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:</p>
            
            <span class="said">That woman is coming up with the milk.</span>
            
            <span class="said">The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his
               chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here,
               I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.</span>
            
            
            <p>He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
               plates, saying:

            <p>Haines sat down to pour out the tea.</p>
            
            <span class="said">—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do
               make strong tea, don’t you?</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old
               woman’s wheedling voice:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I
               makes water I makes water.</span>
            
            <span class="said">By 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Jove</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Roman God</span></div>, it is tea, Haines said.</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:</p>
            
            <span class="said">_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she. _Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God
               send you don’t make them in the one pot._</span>
            
            
            <p>He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
               on his knife.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines
               of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
               
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Dundrum</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">suburb</span></div>. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.</span>
            
            
            <p>He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
               brows:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken
               of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?</span>
            
            <span class="said">I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?</span>
            
            <span class="said">I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
               Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth
               and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!</span>
            
            
            <p>Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
               rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:
            </p>
            
            
            <p>_—For old Mary Ann</p>
            
            
            <p>She doesn’t care a damn.</p>
            
            
            <p>But, hising up her petticoats..._</p>
            
            
            <p>He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.</p>
            
            
            <p>The doorway was darkened by an entering form.</p>
            
            <span class="said">The milk, sir!</span>
            
            <span class="said">Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.</span>
            
            
            <p>An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.</p>
            
            <span class="said">That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.</span>
            
            <span class="said">To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.</p>
            
            <span class="said">The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
               the collector of prepuces.</span>
            
            <span class="said">How much, sir? asked the old woman.</span>
            
            <span class="said">A quart, Stephen said.</span>
            
            
            <p>He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
               milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a
               tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a
               messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.
               Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on
               her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They
               lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and
               poor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly
               form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their
               common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to
               upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Taste it, sir, she said.</span>
            
            
            <p>He drank at her bidding.</p>
            
            <span class="said">If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
               loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten
               guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved
               with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.</span>
            
            <span class="said">I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Look at that now, she said.</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice
               that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
               slights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there
               is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in
               God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey. And to the loud voice that now bids
               her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.</span>
            
            
            <p>Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?</span>
            
            <span class="said">—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the
               west, sir?</span>
            
            <span class="said">I am an Englishman, Haines answered.</span>
            
            <span class="said">He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak
               Irish in Ireland.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak
               the language myself. I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill
               us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma’am?</span>
            
            <span class="said">No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
               milkcan on her forearm and about to go.</span>
            
            
            <p>Haines said to her:</p>
            
            <span class="said">Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen filled again the three cups.</p>
            
            <span class="said">Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at
               twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
               mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That’s a
               
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">shilling</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">currency</span></div> and one and two is two and two, sir.</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
               buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search
               his trouser pockets.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
               thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">florin</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">currency</span></div>, twisted it round in
               his fingers and cried:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">A miracle!</span>
            
            
            <p>He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:</p>
            
            <span class="said">Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.</p>
            
            <span class="said">We’ll owe twopence, he said.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good
               morning, sir.</span>
            
            
            <p>She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:</p>
            
            
            <p>_—Heart of my heart, were it more,</p>
            
            
            <p>More would be laid at your feet._</p>
            
            
            <p>He turned to Stephen and said:</p>
            
            <span class="said">Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring
               us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland
               expects that every man this day will do his duty.</span>
            
            <span class="said">That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
               national library today.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.</span>
            
            
            <p>He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:</p>
            
            <span class="said">Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?</span>
            
            
            <p>Then he said to Haines:</p>
            
            <span class="said">The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.</span>
            
            <span class="said">All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
               trickle over a slice of the loaf.</span>
            
            
            <p>Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
               loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.</span>
            
            
            <p>Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.
               Conscience. Yet here’s a spot.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">hat one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
               of Irish art is deuced good.</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with
               warmth of tone:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Wait till you hear him on 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Hamlet</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">tragedy</span></div>, Haines.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just
               thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.</span>
            
            
            <p>Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of
               the hammock, said:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">I don’t know, I’m sure.</span>
            
            
            <p>He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen
               and said with coarse vigour:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the
               milkwoman or from him. It’s a toss up, I think.</span>
            
            <span class="said">—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
               with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.</span>
            
            <span class="said">I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.</p>
            
            <span class="said">From me, Kinch, he said.</span>
            
            
            <p>In a suddenly changed tone he added:</p>
            
            <span class="said">To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else they
               are good for. Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all.
               Let us get out of the kip.</span>
            
            
            <p>He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
               resignedly:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Mulligan is stripped of his garments.</span>
            
            
            <p>He emptied his pockets on to the table.</p>
            
            <span class="said">There’s your snotrag, he said.</span>
            
            
            <p>And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
               chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and
               rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,
               we’ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green
               boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I
               contradict myself. 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Mercurial Malachi</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">nickname</span></div>. A limp black missile flew out of
               his talking hands.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the
               doorway:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Are you coming, you fellows?</span>
            
            <span class="said">I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,
               Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out
               with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:</span>
            
            <span class="said">And going forth he met Butterly.</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
               and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
               locked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:</p>
            
            <span class="said">Did you bring the key?</span>
            
            <span class="said">I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.</span>
            
            
            <p>He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy
               bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Down, sir! How dare you, sir!</span>
            
            <span class="said">Haines asked:</span>
            
            <span class="said">Do you pay rent for this tower?</span>

            <span class="said">To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.</span>
            
            
            <p>They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:</p>
            
            <span class="said">Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on
               the sea. But ours is the 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">_omphalos_</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">artifact</span></div>.</span>
            
            <span class="said">What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.</span>
            
            <span class="said">No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas
               and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I
               have a few pints in me first.</span>
            
            
            <p>He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
               primrose waistcoat:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?</span>
            
            <span class="said">It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.</span>
            
            <span class="said">You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?</span>
            
            <span class="said">—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Wilde</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">author</span></div> and paradoxes.
               It’s quite simple. He proves by algebra that 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Hamlet</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">tragedy</span></div>’s grandson is
               Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
               father.</span>
            
            <span class="said">What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
               loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!</span>
            
            <span class="said">We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is
               rather long to tell.</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.</p>
            
            <span class="said">The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.</span>
            
            <span class="said">I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this
               tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. _That
               beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did
               not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in
               cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.</span>
            
            
            <p>Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.
               The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the
               smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail
               tacking by the Muglins.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.
               The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the
               Father.</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked
               at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
               suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved
               a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and
               began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:
            </p>
            
            
            <p>_

            <p>He held up a forefinger of warning.</p>
            
            
            <p>_—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine
               He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine

            </p>
            
            
            <p>He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running
               forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like
               fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:
            </p>
            
            
            <p>_—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said
               And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.

            </p>
            
            
            <p>He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his
               winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh
               wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and
               said:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m not a
               believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of
               it somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?</span>
            
            <span class="said">The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.</span>
            
            <span class="said">O, Haines said, you have heard it before?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.</span>
            
            <span class="said">You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in
               the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a
               personal God.</span>
            
            <span class="said">There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.</span>
            
            
            <p>Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a
               green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.</span>
            
            
            <p>Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his
               sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
               it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
               towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or
               you don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a
               personal God. You don’t stand for that, I suppose?</span>
            
            <span class="said">You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
               example of free thought.</span>
            
            
            <p>He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his
               side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.
               My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line
               along the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.
               He wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt
               bread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his
               eyes.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">After all, Haines began...</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was
               not all unkind.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your
               own master, it seems to me.</span>
            
            <span class="said">I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an
               Italian.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Italian? Haines said.</span>
            
            
            <p>A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.</p>
            
            <span class="said">And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?</span>
            
            <span class="said">The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and
               the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.</span>
            
            
            <p>Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he
               spoke.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think
               like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you
               rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.</span>
            
            
            <p>The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of
               their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam
               ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own
               rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass
               for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in
               affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church
               militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies
               fleeing with mitres awry: 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Photius</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">god</span></div> and the brood of mockers of whom
               Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the
               consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and 
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Valentine</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">saint</span></div>, spurning
               Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who
               held that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken
               a moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void
               awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a
               worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who
               defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their
               shields.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.

            </p>
            
            <span class="said">—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. I
               don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.
               That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.</span>
            
            
            <p>Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,
               boatman.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">She’s making for Bullock harbour.</span>
            
            
            <p>The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.</p>
            
            <span class="said">There’s five fathoms out there, he said. It’ll be swept up that way
               when the tide comes in about one. It’s nine days today.</span>
            
            
            <p>The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting
               for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,
               saltwhite. Here I am.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood
               on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his
               shoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly
               frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Is the brother with you, Malachi?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young
               thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.</span>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near
               the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,
               water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
               rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
               sagging loincloth.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
               and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and
               lips and breastbone.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
               rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?</span>
            
            <span class="said">Yes.</span>
            
            <span class="said">—Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with

            <span class="said">Better ask Seymour that.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.</span>
            
            
            <p>He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
               tritely:

            <span class="said">Redheaded women buck like goats.</span>
            
            
            <p>He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.</p>

            <p>He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
               clothes lay.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said"> Are you going in here, Malachi?</span>

            <p>The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the
               middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a
               stone, smoking.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen turned away.</p>
            
            <span class="said">I’m going, Mulligan, he said.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
               clothes.
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.</span>
            
            
            <p>Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck
               Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
            </p>
            
            <span class="said">He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake
               
               <div class="tooltip"><span class="reference"><span class="dropdown">Zarathustra</span></span><span class="tooltiptext">Prohet</span></div>.</span>
            
            
            <p>His plump body plunged.</p>
            
            <span class="said">We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the
               path and smiling at wild Irish.</span>
            
            
            <p>Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.</p>
            
            <span class="said">The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.</span>
            
            <span class="said">Good, Stephen said.</span>
            
            
            <p>He walked along the upwardcurving path.

            <p>The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will
               not sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning
               the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a
               seal’s, far out on the water, round.
            </p>
