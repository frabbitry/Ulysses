      <p>Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
         lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow
         dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild
         morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">_<span ref="Catholic Mass">Introibo ad altare Dei</span>_.</span>
      
      
      <p>Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful <span ref="religious group">jesuit</span>!</span>
      
      
      <p>Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about
         and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
         awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent
         towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
         and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
         his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
         gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
         untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
         bowl smartly.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Back to barracks! he said sternly.</span>
      
      
      <p>He added in a preacher’s tone:</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul
         and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One
         moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.</span>
      
      
      <p>He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
         awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and
         there with gold points. <span ref="Saint">Chrysostomos</span>. Two strong shrill whistles
         answered through the calm.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off
         the current, will you?</span>
      
      
      <p>He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering
         about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and
         sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.
         A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!</span>
      
      
      <p>He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
         laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
         halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
         he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
         lathered cheeks and neck.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.</p>
      
      <span class="Malachi Mulligan">My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a
         <span ref="Greek">Hellenic</span> ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We
         must go to <span ref="Greek">Athens</span>. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out
         twenty quid?</span>
      
      
      <p>He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:</p>
      
      <span class="">Will he come? The jejune <span ref="Religious Group">jesuit</span>!</span>
      
      
      <p>Ceasing, he began to shave with care.</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Yes, my love?</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous <span ref="ethnicity">Saxon</span>. He thinks
         you’re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money
         and indigestion. Because he comes from <span ref="place">Oxford</span>. You know, Dedalus, you
         have the real <span ref="place">Oxford</span> manner. He can’t make you out. O, my name for you
         is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.</span>
      
      
      <p>He shaved warily over his chin.</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is
         his guncase?</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark
         with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
         black panther. You saved men from drowning. I’m not a hero, however. If
         he stays on here I am off.</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down
         from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Scutter! he cried thickly.</span>
      
      
      <p>He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper
         pocket, said:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
         dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.
         Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.
         You can almost taste it, can’t you?</span>
      
      
      <p>He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
         oakpale hair stirring slightly.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">—God! he said quietly. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet
         mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. _Epi oinopa
         ponton_. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them
         in the original. <span ref="Greek">_Thalatta! Thalatta!_</span> She is our great sweet mother.
         Come and look.</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked
         down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
         Kingstown.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.</span>
      
      
      <p>He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s
         face.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That’s why she won’t
         let me have anything to do with you.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.</span>
      
      <span class="">You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother
         asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I’m<span ref="Race of Giants"> hyperborean</span> as much as you. But to
         think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and
         pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you....</span>
      
      
      <p>He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant
         smile curled his lips.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest
         mummer of them all!</span>
      
      
      <p>He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.</p>
      
      
      <p>Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
         his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.
         Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently,
         in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within
         its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,
         her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
         wetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a
         great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and
         skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had
         stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had
         torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt
         and a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">They fit well enough, Stephen answered.</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">—The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God
         knows what <span ref="low life">poxy bowsy</span> left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair
         stripe, grey. You’ll look spiffing in them. I’m not joking, Kinch. You
         look damn well when you’re dressed.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Thanks, Stephen said. I can’t wear them if they are grey.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.
         Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey
         trousers.</span>
      
      
      <p>He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
         smooth skin.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
         smokeblue mobile eyes.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
         says you have g. p. i. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.
         General paralysis of the insane!</span>
      
      
      <p>He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings
         abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips
         laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized
         all his strong wellknit trunk.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by
         a crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this
         face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her
         all right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.
         Lead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.</span>
      
      
      <p>Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If
         Wilde were only alive to see you!</span>
      
      
      <p>Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him
         round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he
         had thrust them.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.
         God knows you have more spirit than any of them.</span>
      
      
      <p>Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The
         cold steel pen.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap
         downstairs and touch him for a guinea. He’s stinking with money and
         thinks you’re not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling
         jalap to <span ref="African Tribe">Zulus</span> or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and
         I could only work together we might do something for the island.
         Hellenise it.</span>
      
      
      <p>Cranly’s arm. His arm.</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I’m the only one
         that knows what you are. Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up
         your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll
         bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave
         <span ref="person">Clive Kempthorpe</span>.</span>
      
      
      <p>Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms. Palefaces:
         they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall
         expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit
         ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the
         table, with trousers down at heels, chased by<span allusion="Oscar Wilde"> Ades of Magdalen</span> with the
         tailor’s shears. A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade. I don’t
         want to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf
         gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower
         on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>To ourselves... new <span ref="religion">paganism</span>... <span ref="artifact">omphalos</span>.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Let him stay, Stephen said. There’s nothing wrong with him except at
         night.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I’m
         quite frank with you. What have you against me now?</span>
      
      
      <p>They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on
         the water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm
         quietly.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus"> Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.</span>
      
      <span class=" Buck Mulligan">Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don’t remember anything.</span>
      
      
      <p>He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,
         fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of
         anxiety in his eyes.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s
         death?</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">What? Where? I can’t remember anything. I remember only ideas and
         sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get
         more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the
         drawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is
         beastly dead._</span>
      
      
      <p>A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck
         Mulligan’s cheek.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?</span>
      
      
      <p>He shook his constraint from him nervously.</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw
         only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and
         Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It’s a beastly
         thing and nothing else. It simply doesn’t matter. You wouldn’t kneel
         down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why?
         Because you have the cursed <span ref="Religious Group">jesuit</span> strain in you, only it’s injected
         the wrong way. To me it’s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes
         are not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks
         buttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it’s over. You crossed her
         last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like
         some hired mute from <span ref="Mute">Lalouette’s</span>. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I
         didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.</span>
      
      
      <p>He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping
         wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.</span>
      
      
      <p>He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,
         gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now
         grew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he
         felt the fever of his cheeks.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A voice within the tower called loudly:</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Are you up there, Mulligan?</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.</span>
      
      
      <p>He turned towards Stephen and said:</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,
         Kinch, and come on down. The <span ref="English">Sassenach</span> wants his morning rashers.</span>
      
      
      <p>His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level
         with the roof:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Don’t mope over it all day, he said. I’m inconsequent. Give up the
         moody brooding.</span>
      
      
      <p>His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
         the stairhead:
         
         <span ref="poem"> And no more turn aside and brood
            Upon love’s bitter mystery
            For Fergus rules the brazen cars</span>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the
         stairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of
         water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the
         dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the
         harpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words
         shimmering on the dim tide.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in
         deeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus’
         song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.
         Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and
         pity I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For
         those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Where now?</p>
      
      
      <p>Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,
         a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the
         sunny window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing
         in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he
         sang:
         
         <span ref="poem">I am the boy
            That can enjoy
            Invisibility.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.
         
         And no more turn aside and brood.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his
         brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had
         approached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,
         roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely
         fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s
         shirts.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its
         loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,
         bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On
         me alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the
         tortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all
         prayed on their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. _Liliata
         rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum
         chorus excipiat._
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!</p>
      
      
      <p>No, mother! Let me be and let me live.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Kinch ahoy!</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the
         staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,
         heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is
         apologising for waking us last night. It’s all right.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Do, for <span ref="Christianity">Jesus</span>’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our
         sakes.</span>
      
      
      <p>His head disappeared and reappeared.</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">—I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch
         him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">I get paid this morning, Stephen said.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">If you want it, Stephen said.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have
         a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent
         sovereigns.</span>
      
      
      <p>He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of
         tune with a Cockney accent:
         
         <span ref="song"> O, won’t we have a merry time,
            Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
            On coronation,
            Coronation day!
            O, won’t we have a merry time
            On coronation day!</span></p>
      
      
      <p>Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,
         forgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it
         there all day, forgotten friendship?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
         smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.
         So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now
         and yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form
         moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
         yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
         from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
         coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the
         hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open
         the inner doors.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Have you the key? a voice asked.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan"> Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m choked!</span>
      
      
      <p>He howled, without looking up from the fire:</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Kinch!</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.</span>
      
      
      <p>The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been
         set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the
         doorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and
         sat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
         him. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set
         them down heavily and sighed with relief.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a
         word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.
         Haines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy
         gifts. Where’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk.</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
         the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s a lemon in the
         locker.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove
         milk.</span>
      
      
      <p>Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:</p>
      
      <span class="Haines">That woman is coming up with the milk.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his
         chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here,
         I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.</span>
      
      
      <p>He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
         plates, saying:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan"><span ref="Trinitarian Forumla">_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._</span></span>
      
      
      <p>Haines sat down to pour out the tea.</p>
      
      <span class="Haines">—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do
         make strong tea, don’t you?</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old
         woman’s wheedling voice:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I
         makes water I makes water.</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">By <span ref="Roman God">Jove</span>, it is tea, Haines said.</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she. _Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God
         send you don’t make them in the one pot._</span>
      
      
      <p>He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
         on his knife.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines
         of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
         <span ref="suburb">Dundrum</span>. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.</span>
      
      
      <p>He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
         brows:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken
         of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
         Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth
         and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!</span>
      
      
      <p>Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
         rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:
      </p>
      
      
      <p>_—For old Mary Ann</p>
      
      
      <p>She doesn’t care a damn.</p>
      
      
      <p>But, hising up her petticoats..._</p>
      
      
      <p>He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.</p>
      
      
      <p>The doorway was darkened by an entering form.</p>
      
      <span class="Haines">The milk, sir!</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.</span>
      
      
      <p>An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.</p>
      
      <span class="Old Woman">That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
         the collector of prepuces.</span>
      
      <span class="Old Woman">How much, sir? asked the old woman.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">A quart, Stephen said.</span>
      
      
      <p>He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
         milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a
         tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a
         messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.
         Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on
         her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They
         lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and
         poor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly
         form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their
         common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to
         upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.</span>
      
      <span class="Old Woman">Taste it, sir, she said.</span>
      
      
      <p>He drank at her bidding.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
         loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten
         guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved
         with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.</span>
      
      <span class="Old Woman">Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.</span>
      
      <span class="Old Woman">Look at that now, she said.</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice
         that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
         slights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there
         is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in
         God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey. And to the loud voice that now bids
         her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.</span>
      
      <span class="Old Woman">Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.</span>
      
      
      <p>Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?</span>
      
      <span class="Old Woman">—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the
         west, sir?</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">I am an Englishman, Haines answered.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak
         Irish in Ireland.</span>
      
      <span class="Old Woman">Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak
         the language myself. I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill
         us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma’am?</span>
      
      <span class="Old Woman">No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
         milkcan on her forearm and about to go.</span>
      
      
      <p>Haines said to her:</p>
      
      <span class="Haines">Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen filled again the three cups.</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at
         twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
         mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That’s a
         <span ref="currency">shilling</span> and one and two is two and two, sir.</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
         buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search
         his trouser pockets.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Haines">Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
         thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a <span ref="currency">florin</span>, twisted it round in
         his fingers and cried:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">A miracle!</span>
      
      
      <p>He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:</p>
      
      <span class="Old Woman">Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">We’ll owe twopence, he said.</span>
      
      <span class="Old Woman">Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good
         morning, sir.</span>
      
      
      <p>She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:</p>
      
      
      <p>_—Heart of my heart, were it more,</p>
      
      
      <p>More would be laid at your feet._</p>
      
      
      <p>He turned to Stephen and said:</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring
         us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland
         expects that every man this day will do his duty.</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
         national library today.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.</span>
      
      
      <p>He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?</span>
      
      
      <p>Then he said to Haines:</p>
      
      <span class="Haines">The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
         trickle over a slice of the loaf.</span>
      
      
      <p>Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
         loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Haines">I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.</span>
      
      
      <p>Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.
         Conscience. Yet here’s a spot.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">hat one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
         of Irish art is deuced good.</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with
         warmth of tone:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Wait till you hear him on <span ref="tragedy">Hamlet</span>, Haines.</span>
      
      
      <p>Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just
         thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.</span>
      
      
      <p>Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of
         the hammock, said:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Haines">I don’t know, I’m sure.</span>
      
      
      <p>He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen
         and said with coarse vigour:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the
         milkwoman or from him. It’s a toss up, I think.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
         with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.</span>
      
      <span class="">I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">From me, Kinch, he said.</span>
      
      
      <p>In a suddenly changed tone he added:</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else they
         are good for. Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all.
         Let us get out of the kip.</span>
      
      
      <p>He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
         resignedly:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Haines">Mulligan is stripped of his garments.</span>
      
      
      <p>He emptied his pockets on to the table.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">There’s your snotrag, he said.</span>
      
      
      <p>And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
         chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and
         rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,
         we’ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green
         boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I
         contradict myself. <span ref="nickname">Mercurial Malachi</span>. A limp black missile flew out of
         his talking hands.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the
         doorway:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Are you coming, you fellows?</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,
         Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out
         with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">And going forth he met Butterly.</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
         and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
         locked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:</p>
      
      <span class="">Did you bring the key?</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.</span>
      
      
      <p>He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy
         bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Down, sir! How dare you, sir!</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">Haines asked:</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus ">Do you pay rent for this tower?</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Twelve <span ref="currency">quid</span>, Buck Mulligan said.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.</span>
      
      
      <p>They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:</p>
      
      <span class="Haines">Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on
         the sea. But ours is the <span ref="artifact">_omphalos_</span>.</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas
         and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I
         have a few pints in me first.</span>
      
      
      <p>He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
         primrose waistcoat:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of <span ref="author">Wilde</span> and paradoxes.
         It’s quite simple. He proves by algebra that <span ref="tragedy">Hamlet</span>’s grandson is
         Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
         father.</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
         loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is
         rather long to tell.</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this
         tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. _That
         beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did
         not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in
         cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Haines">It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.</span>
      
      
      <p>Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.
         The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the
         smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail
         tacking by the Muglins.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.
         The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the
         Father.</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked
         at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
         suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved
         a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and
         began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:
      </p>
      
      
      <p>_<span ref="prayer">—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.
            My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.
            With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.
            So here’s to disciples and Calvary._</span></p>
      
      
      <p>He held up a forefinger of warning.</p>
      
      
      <p>_—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine
         He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine
         But have to drink water and wish it were plain
         That I make when the wine becomes water again._
      </p>
      
      
      <p>He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running
         forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like
         fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:
      </p>
      
      
      <p>_—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said
         And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.
         What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
         And Olivet’s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!_
      </p>
      
      
      <p>He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his
         winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh
         wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and
         said:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Haines">We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m not a
         believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of
         it somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">O, Haines said, you have heard it before?</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in
         the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a
         personal God.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.</span>
      
      
      <p>Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a
         green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.</span>
      
      
      <p>Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his
         sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
         it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
         towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Haines">Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or
         you don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a
         personal God. You don’t stand for that, I suppose?</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
         example of free thought.</span>
      
      
      <p>He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his
         side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.
         My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line
         along the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.
         He wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt
         bread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his
         eyes.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Haines">After all, Haines began...</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was
         not all unkind.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your
         own master, it seems to me.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an
         Italian.</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">Italian? Haines said.</span>
      
      
      <p>A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and
         the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.</span>
      
      
      <p>Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he
         spoke.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Haines">I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think
         like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you
         rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.</span>
      
      
      <p>The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of
         their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam
         ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own
         rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass
         for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in
         affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church
         militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies
         fleeing with mitres awry: <span ref="god">Photius</span> and the brood of mockers of whom
         Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the
         consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and <span ref="saint">Valentine</span>, spurning
         Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who
         held that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken
         a moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void
         awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a
         worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who
         defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their
         shields.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. <span ref="French">_Zut! Nom de Dieu!_</span></p>
      
      <span class="Haines">—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. I
         don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.
         That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.</span>
      
      
      <p>Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,
         boatman.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Haines">She’s making for Bullock harbour.</span>
      
      
      <p>The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.</p>
      
      <span class="Boatman">There’s five fathoms out there, he said. It’ll be swept up that way
         when the tide comes in about one. It’s nine days today.</span>
      
      
      <p>The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting
         for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,
         saltwhite. Here I am.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood
         on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his
         shoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly
         frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Is the brother with you, Malachi?</span>
      
      <span class="Malachi Mulligan">Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young
         thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.</span>
      
      <span class="Malachi Mulligan">Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.</span>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near
         the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,
         water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
         rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
         sagging loincloth.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
         and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and
         lips and breastbone.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
         rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.</span>
      
      <span class="">Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.</span>
      
      <span class="Malachi Mulligan">Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Yes.</span>
      
      <span class="Malachi Mulligan">—Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with
         money.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Is she up the pole?</span>
      
      <span class="Malachi Mulligan">Better ask Seymour that.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.</span>
      
      
      <p>He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
         tritely:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Malachi mulligan">Redheaded women buck like goats.</span>
      
      
      <p>He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I’m the <span ref="German">_Übermensch.</span>_ Toothless
         Kinch and I, the supermen.</span>
      
      
      <p>He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
         clothes lay.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan"> Are you going in here, Malachi?</span>
      
      <span class="Malachi Mulligan">Yes. Make room in the bed.</span>
      
      
      <p>The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the
         middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a
         stone, smoking.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.</span>
      
      <span class="Haines">Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen turned away.</p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">I’m going, Mulligan, he said.</span>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
         clothes.
      </p>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.</span>
      
      
      <p>Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck
         Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
      </p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake
         <span ref="Prohet">Zarathustra</span>.</span>
      
      
      <p>His plump body plunged.</p>
      
      <span class="Haines">We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the
         path and smiling at wild Irish.</span>
      
      
      <p>Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.</p>
      
      <span class="Buck Mulligan">The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.</span>
      
      <span class="Stephen Dedalus">Good, Stephen said.</span>
      
      
      <p>He walked along the upwardcurving path.
         
         <span ref="poem">Liliata rutilantium.
            Turma circumdet.

      <p>The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will
         not sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning
         the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a
