            <h2>Most Common References</h2>
            <p>In Dame Street, Henry James is referenced.</p>
            <p><a href = "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-James-American-writer">Henry James</a> (1843-1916) was an American novelist, who wrote, among other things, <i>Daisy Miller</i> and <i>Portrait of a Lady.</i></p>
            <h2>This Location in <i>Ulysses</i></h2>
            <p>The only allusion included in this location was a reference to an American novelist, who often wrote of the contrast between innocence - often present in the New World - and experience - often present in the Old World. Perhaps Joyce thought of this location in a literary sense and was reminded of the clash between innocence and experience.</p>
