            <h2>Most Common References</h2>
            <p>In this location, an allusion to Edward Fitzball was made.</p>
            <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Fitzball">Edward Fitzball</a> (1792-1873) was an English playwright who specialized in melodrama. Two of his works were "Floating Beacon" and "Pilot."</p>
            <h2>This Location in <i>Ulysses</i></h2>
            <p>The only allusion made in this location was a reference to Fitzball, who was particularly talented at writing nautical dramas. Perhaps Joyce thought of this location in a dramatic, literary sense and in a seafaring way.</p>
