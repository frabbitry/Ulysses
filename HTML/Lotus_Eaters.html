     <p>By lorries along sir John Rogerson’s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
         Windmill lane, Leask’s the linseed crusher, 
      the postal telegraph
         office. Could have given that address too. And past the sailors’ home.
      He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through
         Lime street. By Brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket
         of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of
         eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered
         caskhoop. Tell him if he smokes he won’t grow. O let him! His life
         isn’t such a bed of roses. Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come
         home to ma, da. Slack hour: won’t be many there. He crossed Townsend
         street, passed the frowning face of <span class="reference">Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph</span>,
         Beth.And past Nichols’ <span class="reference">the undertaker</span>. At eleven it is.<span class="location"> Time enough.

         <p>In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and <span class="reference">Oriental</span>
            Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,
            finest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from <span class="reference">Tom
               Kernan.</span> Couldn’t ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still
            read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent
            his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm
            morning. Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the
            leather headband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand
            came down into the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card
            behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and
            hair. Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice
            blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it
            must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,
            cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like
            that. Those <span class="reference">Cinghalese</span> lobbing about in the sun in <span class="reference">_dolce far niente_</span>,

            the <span class="reference">dead sea</span> floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.
            Couldn’t sink if you tried: so thick with salt. Because the weight of
            the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the
            weight of the what? Or is it the volume is equal to the weight? It’s a
            <span class="allusion">law</span> something like that. Vance in High school cracking his
            fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum. Cracking curriculum.
            What is weight really when you say the weight? Thirtytwo feet per
            second per second. Law of falling bodies: per second per second. They
            all fall to the ground. The earth. <span class="reference">It’s the force of gravity of the

         <p>He turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with her
            sausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded
            <span class="allusion">_Freeman_</span> from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a
            baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.
            Careless air: just drop in to see. Per second per second. Per second
            for every second it means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance
            through the door of the postoffice. Too late box. Post here. No-one.

         <p>The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a

            He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if
            that would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger
            felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.
            Women will pay a lot of heed, I don’t think. His fingers drew forth the
            letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something
            pinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.

         <span class="said">—Just keeping alive, M’Coy said.</span>

         <span class="said">—To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?</span>
         
         
         <p>A photo it isn’t. A badge maybe.</p>
         
         <span class="said">—E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.

         <span class="said">—I must try to get out there, M’Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard

         <span class="said">—I know.</span>
         
         
         <p>Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door
            of the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She
            stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her,
            searched his pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll
            collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Careless
            stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty
            creature at the polo match. Women all for caste till you touch the
            spot. Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The

         <p>Doran Lyons in Conway’s. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came
            Hoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath
            his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the
            braided drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight

            heard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it

            Can’t he hear the difference? Think he’s that way inclined a bit.
            Against my grain somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope
            that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse. Suppose she wouldn’t let

         <p>Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the
            hazard. No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn’t met
            that M’Coy fellow.
         </p>
         <p>He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently
            champing teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid
            the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn
            all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in
            nosebags. Too full for words. Still they get their feed all right and
            their doss. Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp
            between their haunches. Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor
            brutes they look. Still their neigh can be very irritating.
         </p>
         <p>He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he
            carried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.
         </p>
         <p>He passed the cabman’s shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies.
            All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.
            _Voglio e non_. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a
            few flying syllables as they pass. He hummed:
         </p>
         <p>     Là ci darem la mano
            La la lala la la.
         </p>
      
      
      He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in
         the lee of the station wall. No-one. 
         <p>Meade’s timberyard. Piled balks.
            Ruins and tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch
            court with its forgotten pickeystone. <span class="reference">Not a sinner.</span> Near the timberyard

         <p>A flower. I think it’s a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not
            annoyed then? What does she say?

         <p>Dear Henry</p>
         
         
         <p>I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry
            you did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am
            awfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called
            you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me
            what is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home
            you poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you.
            Please tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the
            beautiful name you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you
            so often you have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a
            man as you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell
            me more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what
            I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to
            meet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are
            exhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I
            have such a bad headache. today. and write _by return_ to your longing

         <p>P. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to
            know.
         </p>
         
         
         
         <p>He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell
            and placed it in his heart pocket. <span class="reference">Language of flowers.</span> They like it
            because no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then
            walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and
            there a word. Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your

            back in his sidepocket.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did
            she wrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like
            me, respectable character. <span class="reference">Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.</span>
            Thank you: not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round
            corners. Bad as a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic.
            Go further next time. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.
            Brutal, why not? Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.
            Common pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere:
            pinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses
            without thorns.
         </p>
      
      
         <p>Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in
            the Coombe, linked together in the rain.
         </p>
         <p>     O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.
            She didn’t know what to do
            To keep it up,
            To keep it up.
         </p>
         <p>It? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting all
            day typing. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your
            wife use. Now could you make out a thing like that?
         </p>
         <p>     To keep it up.</p>
         <p><span class="reference">Martha, Mary.</span> I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or
            faked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious.
            Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.
         </p>
         <p>     To keep it up.</p>
         <p>Nice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there:
            quiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have
            been, strange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the
            supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like

            her: more and more: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.
         </p>
         <p>Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly
            in shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered
            away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.

         <p>Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the
            same way. Simple bit of paper. <span class="person">Lord Iveagh</span> once cashed a sevenfigure
            cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be

            his shirt four times a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A

            eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of
            porter. One and four into twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen
            millions of barrels of porter.
         </p>
         <p>What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the
            same.
         </p>
         <p>An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.
            Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The
            bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing
            together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy
            pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.

         <p>He had reached the open backdoor of <span class="reference">All Hallows.</span> Stepping into the
            porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it
            again behind the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work

            Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced,
            listening. Still life. Lap it up like milk, I suppose.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps,
            pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.

            benches with <span class="reference">crimson halters</span> round their necks, heads bowed. A batch
            knelt at the altarrails. The priest went along by them, murmuring,
            holding <span class="reference">the thing</span> in his hands. He stopped at each, took out a
            communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it
            neatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her
            hat sank at once. Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent
            down to put it into her mouth, <span class="reference">murmuring all the time. Latin.</span> The next
            one. Shut your eyes and open your mouth. What? _Corpus:_ body. Corpse.

         <p>He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by
            one, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in
            its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear.
            We ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here
            and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for
            it to melt in their stomachs. Something like those <span class="reference">mazzoth</span>: it’s that
            sort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes

         <p>He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an
            instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace
            affair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn’t know what
            to do to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: <span class="reference">I.N.R.I?</span> No: <span class="reference">I.H.S.</span>

            O, no, she’s not here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up
            that envelope? Yes: under the bridge.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>The priest was <span class="reference">rinsing out the chalice: </span>then he tossed off the dregs
            smartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank
            what they are used to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage

            the whole atmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music.
            Pity. Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make
            that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he
            had <span class="reference">in Gardiner street</span>. Molly was in fine voice that day, <span class="reference">the _Stabat

            Footdrill stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice
            against that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the
            people looking up:

         <p><span class="allusion">_Quis est homo._</span></p>

            Kind of a placid. No worry. <span class="reference">Fall into flesh,</span> don’t they? Gluttons,

         <p><span class="reference">He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and

            glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand
            up at the <span class="reference">gospel</span> of course. Then all settled down on their knees again
            and he sat back quietly in his bench. <span class="reference">The priest came down from the
               altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered

            time? Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there’s a

            before. Still like you better untidy. Good job it wasn’t farther south.
            He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the
            main door into the light. He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black
            marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive
            hands in the low tide of holy water. Trams: a car of <span class="person">Prescott’s</span>

         <span class="said">—Yes, Mr Bloom said.</span>
         
         
         <p>He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the
            dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling

            longing I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time
            for massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.
            
         </p>
         <span class="said">—Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a
            bottle?</span>
         
         <span class="said">—No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I’ll call later in the day and
            I’ll take one of these soaps. How much are they?</span>
         
         <span class="said">—Fourpence, sir.</span>
         
         
         <p>Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.</p>
         
         <span class="said">—I’ll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.</span>
         
         <span class="said">—Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you
            come back.</span>
         
         <span class="said">—Good, Mr Bloom said.</span>
         
         
         <p>He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the
            coolwrappered soap in his left hand.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>At his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said:</p>
         
         <span class="said">—Hello, Bloom. What’s the best news? Is that today’s? Show us a minute.</span>
         
         
         <p>Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look
            younger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Bantam Lyons’s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a
            wash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears’
            soap? Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.
         </p>
         
         <span class="said">—I want to see about that French horse that’s running today, Bantam
            Lyons said. Where the bugger is it?</span>
         
         
         <p>He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.
            Barber’s itch. Tight collar he’ll lose his hair. Better leave him the
            paper and get shut of him.

         <p>Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.</p>
         
         <span class="said">—What’s that? his sharp voice said.</span>
         
         <span class="said">—I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it away
            that moment.</span>
         
         
         <p>Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread
            sheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms.
         </p>
         
         <span class="said">—I’ll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.</span>
         
         
         <p>He sped off towards Conway’s corner. God speed scut.</p>
         
         
         <p>Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap
            in it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it

         He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of
         warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk
         and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,
         lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of
         his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father
         of thousands, a languid floating flower.</span>
