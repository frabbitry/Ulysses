            <p>With the Ulysses Project, we are attempting to examine how James Joyce recreated the
                city of Dublin in <i>Ulysses</i>. As the <a
                    href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/fodors/top/features/travel/destinations/europe/ireland/dublin/fdrs_feat_60_5.html"
                    >New York Times chronicles, “Joyce knew and remembered Dublin in such detail
                    that he bragged (and that’s the word) that if the city were destroyed, it could
                    be rebuilt in its entirety from his written works.”</a>
                <i>Ulysses</i>, through the story of Leopold Bloom’s walk through the city on June
                16, 1904, uses sparse detail but frequently mentioned location names to paint the
                city. As such, it is hard to picture the city that is described as a "character" of
                Joyce's novels. However, allusions, as a method of characterization, are present
                throughout the novel's various settings. We have examined the allusions present is
                various settings to help us gain insight into the city that James Joyce hated so
                much. </p>

            <p>We used XML to tag several chapters of Ulysses, including <a href="Telemachus.html"
                    >“Telemachus,”</a>
                <a href="Nestor.html">"Nestor,”</a>
                <a href="Proteus.html">“Proteus,”</a>
                <a href="Calypso.html">“Calypso,”</a>

            <p>We then used QGIS to map the settings included within those sections and create
                heatmaps based on allusions used most frequently, and we also used Cytoscape to
                create network graphs showing, perhaps more explicitly, the relationships between
                specific locations and allusions.</p>

            <p>While we believe that these graphical representations of Joyce’s Dublin are
                interesting, they are incomplete. Because of time limitations, we weren’t able to
                encode and work with the whole novel, only the sections listed above. Moreover, many
                of the specific locations that existed in 1904 are no longer present, and so our
                location data is sometimes inaccurate because we had to make educated guesses about
                where those places are now. It is also very possible that we incorrectly coded or
                neglected to code certain references or allusions. Nevertheless, we believe that our
                project provides an interesting glimpse into the way that Joyce recreated Dublin
                through allusions in Ulysses. We hope that you enjoy the project website and find
                our results interesting.</p>
