        <h1>The Ulysses Project</h1>
        <!--#include virtual="menu.html" -->
        <p>Yes yes yes! There is a project in the works that will attempt to do the following: </p>
        <ul class = "center">
            <li>Use XML to tag <i>Ulysses</i> by James Joyce for literary allusions, other references, and locations.</li>
            <li>Use that marked up document to compile a map that will show the Dublin locations where parts of the book are set.</li>
            <li>Correlate the locations where the book are set with the types of references and allusions made at those locations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This project is being done through the Digital Humanities: Coding and Visualization class at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg.</p>
        <p>The project team members are Fiona, Kiara, and Brad.</p>
