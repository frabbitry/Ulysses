        <h1>The Ulysses Project</h1>
        <!--#include virtual="menu.html" -->
        <p>With the Ulysses Project, we are attempting to examine how James Joyce recreated the city of Dublin in <i>Ulysses</i>. As the 
            <a href = "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/fodors/top/features/travel/destinations/europe/ireland/dublin/fdrs_feat_60_5.html">New York Times chronicles</a>, “Joyce knew and remembered Dublin in such detail that he bragged (and that’s the word) 
            that if the city were destroyed, it could be rebuilt in its entirety from his written works.” <i>Ulysses</i>, through the story of
            Leopold Bloom’s walk through the city on June 16, 1904, uses vivid detail to paint the city. However, <i>Ulysses</i> did not only 
            recreate the city of Dublin; it attempted to retell <i>The Odyssey</i>, which is one of the reasons why <i>Ulysses</i> has stood the test
            of time as a hallmark of Modernist literature. The book in and of itself is a literary allusion. Therefore, this project 
            looks at how Joyce recreated Dublin through the use of literary allusions and references. We examine the allusions and 
            references Joyce uses at each of the book’s settings to try and gain a better understanding of how those allusions were 
            used to build his Dublin. </p>
        <p>	As such, we have attempted to pinpoint the settings included in <i>Ulysses</i> and the references included within them to see how 
            they were related. We used XML to tag several chapters of Ulysses, including <a href = "Telemachus.html">“Telemachus,”</a> <a href = "Nestor.html">"Nestor,”</a> <a href = "Proteus.html">“Proteus,”</a> <a href = "Calypso.html">“Calypso,”</a> 
            <a href = "Cyclops.html">“Cyclops,”</a> <a href = "Wandering_Rocks.html">“Wandering Rocks,”</a> <a href = "Lotus_Eaters.html">“Lotus Eaters,”</a> <a href = "Eaumus.html">“Eumaeus,”</a> <a href = "Ithaca.html">“Ithaca,”</a> and <a href = "Penelope.html">“Penelope.”</a> We then used QGIS to map the settings 
            included within those sections and create heatmaps based on allusions used most frequently, and we also used Cytoscape to 
            create network graphs showing, perhaps more explicitly, the relationships between specific locations and allusions. </p>
        <p>	While we believe that these graphical representations of Joyce’s Dublin are interesting, they are incomplete. Because of 
            time limitations, we weren’t able to encode and work with the whole novel, only the sections listed above. Moreover, many 
            of the specific locations that existed in 1904 are no longer present, and so our location data is sometimes inaccurate 
            because we had to make educated guesses about where those places are now. It is also very possible that we incorrectly 
            coded or neglected to code certain references or allusions. Nevertheless, we believe that our project provides an 
            interesting glimpse into the way that Joyce recreated Dublin through allusions in Ulysses. We hope that you enjoy the 
            project website and find our results interesting. </p>
