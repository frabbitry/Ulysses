            <h1>The Wanderings of Ulysses</h1>
            <h2>About the Section</h2>
            <p>"The Wanderings of Ulysses", the second section of <i>Ulysses</i>, is comprised of
                twelve chapters, four of which we analyzed. The four sections we worked with are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="Calypso.html">Calypso</a></li>
                <li><a href="Lotus_Eaters.html">Lotus Eaters</a></li>
                <li><a href="WanderingRoc.html">Wandering Rocks</a></li>
                <li><a href="Cyclops.html">Cyclops</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>In these four chapters, we encoded 95 locations, which are included on the left.</p>

            <p> Considering the homeric parallel, we can remember that the sections of <i>The
                    Odyssey</i> that most closely correlate with the chapters in "Wanderings" are
                the ones where Odysseus is trying to get home, while running into, for example, the
                Cyclops or the Oxen of the Sun. Therefore, we can see in "Wanderings" that Bloom and
                other characters are walking around the city of Dublin, trying to get back home. For
                this reason, the number of settings in chapters taken from "Wanderings" is much
                greater than the number of settings taken from either "The Telemachiad" or "The
                Homecoming." </p>
            <h2>Most Common Allusions</h2>

            <p>The most common allusions in "The Wanderings of Ulysses" were references to
                Catholicism, to Christianity, and to Jesuits. There were 37 references to
                Catholicism, 17 references to Christianity, and 5 references to Jesuits.</p>
            <p>There were 378 total allusions coded in "Wanderings."</p>
            <h2>Map</h2>
            <p>The following map is a map of the locations of the "Wanderings" section. Most of the
                locations, visible on the map as purple dots, are centered in Dublin. While we have listed most of these to the side, due to time constraints we were unable to create separate pages for every location. However, several of them, such as Island Street or The Coombe, are finished and are examples of what we hope will be all of the locations listed to the side in the future.</p>

            <p>The following heatmap displays the concentration of allusions, weighted by the most
                common allusions. The heatmap has been zoomed into Dublin so as to feature the most
                prominent locations as decided by allusion concentration. Within the Dublin
                locations, 7 Eccles Street and College Green are the locations where the allusions
                are most strongly prominent, because they are the lightest purple areas of the
                map.</p>
            <img src="WanderingsHeatmap.png" alt="Wanderings Heat Map" />
            <h2>Network Graph</h2>
            <p>The following network graphs links allusions to locations in "The Wanderings of
                Ulysses".</p>
            <div id="center">
                <a href="Wanderings.svg"><div class="img-magnifier-container">
                        <img id="wanderingszoom" src="Wanderings.svg" width="600" height="400"
                            alt="Wanderings" />
                    </div></a>
            </div>
            <p>From the network graph, we can see that there are many locations featured in
                "Wanderings," 95 separate ones to be exact. This means that the network graph is
                more complex, especially when compared with a simpler-looking network graph, such as
                the one featured on the "Homecoming" page. However, I believe that even though it
                isn't pretty, the network graph from "Wanderings" still provides interesting and
                useful information about the section. Using the magnifier to zoom, we can see that,
                of all of the locations, the most references are made in 7 Eccles Street and 46
                Westland Row, because those are the largest locations surrounded by the largest
                circles of allusions. However, we can also note that there are two subnetworks
                within the larger networks: one subnetwork in which 46 Westland Row is prominent and
                another in which 7 Eccles Street is prominent. The circles designating allusions are
                sized by closeness centrality, which means that the allusions "closest" to the
                locations are the largest. Closeness is determined by how strongly correlated the
                allusion is with the location. Moreover, the circles designating allusions are
                colored according to degree, which means that the allusions that are referenced the
                most often and in the most locations are lighter-colored than the allusions that are
                referenced fewer and in fewer places. As you can see, some of the most commonly
                referenced allusions, such as Catholicism, are some of the lightest colored circles.
