            <h1>The Homecoming</h1>
            <h2>About the Section</h2>
            <p>"The Homecoming," the third and final section of <i>Ulysses</i>, includes three
                chapters, which use two settings, as listed on the side of the page. The three
                chapters of "The Homecoming" are </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="Eamus.html">Eumaeus</a></li>
                <li><a href="Ithaca.html">Ithaca</a></li>
                <li><a href="penelope.html">Penelope</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p> As a parallel to <i>The Odyssey</i>, "The Homecoming" is about Bloom's journey home
                and his reclaimation of that home. </p>
            <p>The two locations featured in this section are the Loopline Bridge and Eccles Street,
                specifically 7 Eccles Street. The Cabman's Shelter, a pub underneath the Loopline
                Bridge, is the setting for Eumaeus, and 7 Eccles Street is the setting for both
                Penelope and Ithaca.</p>
            <h2>Most Common Allusions</h2>
            <p>The three most common allusions in this section were references to Gibraltar, Stephen
                Dedalus (in the sense that Stephen Dedalus, a character in <i>Ulysses</i>, is
                referenced from one of Joyce's other works, in which he is also a character, the
                semi-autobiographical <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>), and
                Christianity.</p>
            <p>Gibraltar was referenced 40 times, Stephen Dedalus was referenced 38 times, and
                Christianity was referenced 20 times.</p>
            <p>There were 622 total allusions coded in "The Homecoming."</p>
            <h2>Map</h2>
            <p>The following map is a map of the locations of the "Homecoming" section.</p>
            <img src="Homecoming.png" alt="Homecoming Map" usemap="#homecoming_map" />

            <map name="homecoming_map">
                    <area alt="Eccles Street" title="Eccles Street" coords="472,83,492,103" href = "7EcclesStreet.html"
                        shape="rect" />
                    <area alt="Loopline Bridge" title="Loopline Bridge" href = "LooplineBridge.html"
                        coords="580,310,601,330" shape="rect" />
            </map>
            <p>You can see that the two locations from the section, Eccles Street and the Loopline
                Bridge, are featured on the map as purple dots.</p>
            <p>The following heatmap displays the concentration of allusions, weighted by the most
                common allusions.</p>
            <img src="HomecomingHeatmap.png" alt="Homecoming Heat Map" />
            <p>As the heatmap shows, the bulk of the allusions are present at the Eccles street
                location because it is a brighter color than the rest of the map. The other
                location, the Loopline Bridge, is only faintly lightened in comparison.</p>
            <h2>Network Graph</h2>
            <p>The following network graph relates allusions to locations pulled exclusively from
                "The Homecoming."</p>
            <a href="Homecoming.svg">
                <div class="img-magnifier-container">
                    <img id="homecomingzoom" src="Homecoming.svg" width="600" height="400"
                        alt="Homecoming" />
                </div></a>
            <p>If you zoom in on the picture using the magnifier, you can see that each of the two
                locations sit at the center or near the center of a circle or semicircle. 7 Eccles
                Street, because it was featured in two of the three locations, has the full circle
                surrounding it because more allusions were made in that setting. Loopline Bridge
                sits in the middle of the semicircle, with a smattering of much smaller allusion
                circles surrounding it. The circles designating allusions are sized by closeness
                centrality, which means that the allusions "closest" to the locations are the
                largest. Closeness is determined by how strongly correlated the allusion is with the
                location. Moreover, the circles designating allusions are colored according to
                degree, which means that the allusions that are referenced the most often and in the
                most locations are lighter-colored than the allusions that are referenced fewer and
                in fewer places. As you can see, some of the most commonly referenced allusions,
                such as Christianity or Stephen Dedalus, are some of the lightest-colored
                circles.</p>
