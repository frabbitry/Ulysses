            <h2>This Location in <i>Ulysses</i></h2>
            <p>In this location, references to a priest and an African people group were made. Walshe was well-known for writing sermons on temperance or the evils of intemperance. The Matabele people experienced a turbulent period in the late 1800s, during which they fought with the British who were colonizing Africa. Perhaps this location reminded Joyce of colonization and the need for temperance.</p>
