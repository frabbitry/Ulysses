# Ulysses
This is the repo for the Ulysses Project, which is a project that will attempt to examine the relationships between Dublin locations and other references/themes present in James Joyce's *Ulysses*. Through this project, we hope to gain a greater understanding of how Joyce recreated the city of Dublin in his novel. In particular, we are hoping to map the locations references in Ulysses so that we can then map those locations to other references.
